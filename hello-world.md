First of all thank you for taking the time to read through my application.  I realize my skillset is not exactly what you're looking for, but I'm very interested in working for SparkFun, so I'm giving it a shot.

I interviewed for a job in receiving just because I did not believe that I had the necessary skillset to apply for this developer job, but in talking with Tai Johnson he convinced me to give it a go.  Either way, I've learned a little in the process.

Here is my very honest assessment of skillset:

- HTML/CSS (9 of 10)
- JavaScript (5 of 10)
- C# (8/10)
- VB.NET (4/10)
- C++ (4/10)
- ASP.NET (8/10)
- OOP/MVC (6/10)
- PHP (3/10)
- Ruby (3/10)
- Git (4/10)
- Database Design (7/10)
- SQL (7/10)
- Caching on open source (0/10)
- Caching on Windows platform (4/10)
- Open source platform (3/10)
- Windows platform (7/10)

I'm really trying to quickly pickup the basics of Zend/CodeIgniter with PHP, Rails/Sinatra with Ruby, Bootstrap and Coffeescript

Here is my very honest assessment of my skills/temperment:

Strengths++:

- I learn and adapt quickly.  I'm a tireless learner.  Put me on something and I'll get to the core of it.
- I'm tireless in my pursuit of a goal.  I'll work all night to accomplish what I want to get done.
- I'm a good collaborative team member.  I keep my mouth shut, absorb everything and provide productive feedback.
- I'm a wellspring of ideas and opinions.
- I do my best when given a task and a timeframe and I'm left to my own devices.  That doesn't mean I won't ask questions.  It just means someone standing over my shoulder will never work.
- I provide a very different perspective than most people.  I've been told I think differently and that is true.  The positive benefit is seeing things from many perspectives and the ability to explain difficult concepts to people with ease.

Weaknesses--:

- I'm sometimes a slow starter.  I have to research and understand something at an atomic level to feel really confident.  It pays dividends later but it can be a liability at the start.
- I'm not always good at sharing all the insights I learn.  Sometimes I get so wrapped up in learning about something I need a prod to get me to discuss it.
- I'm sometimes inflexible in my approach.  If someone can point out a better way I quickly switch, but it has to be demonstrated that the new way is in fact better before I make the switch.
- It takes me a little while to warm up to people and the politics/personalities of a new job.  It's one of the downsides of being an introvert.  I stay on-point on my job and I get a lot done, but dealing with a large amount of people will never be something I'm good at.  However, a small focused group of people I do really fantastic with.
- I'm a wellspring of ideas and opinions
