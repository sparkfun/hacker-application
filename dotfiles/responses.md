My working environment is setup by the menu.sh here; it installs some configuration that I use on my development machines and my linux computer at the house. It's easy to install by just running: wget www.samtorno.com/vim/menu.sh && bash menu.sh

While I'm comfortable using vim for quick fixes, I usually prefer Komodo IDE (though I can use Edit as well) or Netbeans for working on code. Of course, that depends on the language. I find NetBeans is better for C-based projects than Komodo, but I would take Komodo for Python anyday.

My preferred operating system is RHEL-based systems such as Scientific Linux. I'm waiting for Scientific Linux 7 to come out since 6 is no longer supported by Google Chrome so in the interim I'm using Fedora. I do not have an issue running Windows, as long as I have a dev workstation somewhere that I can ssh to or have a powerful enough machine to virtualize. I can run Debian-based desktops in a pinch, but I prefer the Cinnamon Desktop Manager to Gnome3/Unity/KDE/etc.
