I don't use dot files all that often in the work that I do.  Occasionally I will use one as seen in the one example included (yes super simple) or to change Apache settings in other ways for a project/part of a project.  But in general I will usually make these types of settings changes in the Apache config files rather than using .htaccess files to keep the configuration settings together and to allow for disabling of AllowOverride setting which is usually considered a good idea.
