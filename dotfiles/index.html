<!--ugly header. I was going to use bootstrap to polish this up, but I already spent a bunch of time on the code sample 
and I have a life outside of this. I thought this would suffice, but feel free to ask for a polished version :)-->
<h1>My Rational</h1>
<p>I've never really felt the need to go crazy modifying editors. 
I don't really modify dot files much beyond adding shell logins. 
I'm also a little hesitant, because I'm afraid of the law of diminisioning returns in this context.
I do admit that there could be some big unforseen productivity boost that I'm missing out on. Who hasn't be there though?
That's why I head to meetups. If it's that great it's very likely that some evangelist will get all preachy and then I'll have to try it.

<h1>My Environment</h1>
</p>
<p>I've used Ubuntu, Windows and Mac as development environments in the past.
I use to detest Mac because of the cost. Now I love it and think it's worth the price.
I'm currently hooked on sublime text for a gui editor and nano for a command line editor.
I use the built in shell client for connecting to test and production environments. 
Sometimes I use filezilla to transfer files, but only with sftp ticked off. 
I made the horrible mistake of not using the sftp option in the past and I believe it led to one of our servers getting hacked :(.
I've used phing in the past for continuous integration in the past and find simple services like beanstalk for deployment favorable, though it may not suit Sparkfun's needs.
