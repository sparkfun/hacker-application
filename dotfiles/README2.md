I have, over my years as a developer, done lots of modifications to dotfiles.  In the past, I extensively edited email, vi, sh, bash and many other programs to my liking.  As the years have passed, I’ve moved further and further away from making major modifications to these applications.  Why?  Well, there are several reasons:

	1) As the years have passed, these tools have added more ‘out of the box’ features, requiring me to have to do less modifications.  For example, I use vim instead of vi.  Vim has many improvements over just straight vi.  Bash has now included colored prompts and other utilities, so my customizations are less needed.

	2) I flip between a lot of different systems, and I don’t always have my own customizations on all these systems.  If I rely on these customizations, then I struggle on these other systems.  So, I’ve pretty much gone back to just ‘vanilla’ settings.

	3) I’ve changed my toolsets.  I used to use Emacs.  Now I use a full blown IDE such as Eclipse.  These IDE’s provide far more capabilities than just a standard editor.  This includes code formatting, debugging, reference lookups, etc.  They make productivity so much more than the tools that I needed to edit.  Many of these tools also include great ‘best practices’ settings out-of-the-box, so little modification is needed.


What little customizations that I do add includes changes to PATH variables and aliases for certain commands (such as alias cp=‘cp -i’, or alias ls=‘ls -la —color’, or alias du=‘du -kh’).  These are things that I use frequently and like to not always type fully out.  I will also create settings for my different ssh profiles, so I don’t have to enter all the different options for the systems.

Generally, I use my Mac for a lot of development.  I prefer to use Eclipse as my general IDE.  I’m familiar with it and even though I know the support for PHP is not as strong as for say JAVA, have had good success with it.  As mentioned, when working with Virtual machines, I typically ssh into the machine and then use the bare commands as needed.  I prefer Bash as my default shell.
