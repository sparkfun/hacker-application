Experienced developers, particularly those working in a Unix environment, tend to prefer
tools which afford a measure of customization. The standard Unix approach of dotfiles to
customize editors, shells, IRC clients, and the like to the developers liking is something
we're interested in.

In this directory, please include (at your option) either:

  a) A sampling of dotfiles or other configuration from your working environment.

  b) A rationale for your lack of same (complete with some description of your
     preferred working environment).


b) I don't utilize dotfiles to customize editors, shells, or clients.  I am a UX specialist with the understanding of programming practices, theories, and process.  Most of the software I utilize on my computer consists of design software such as Adobe suite, Omnigraffle, Axure, Sketch, and many small apps to help my workflow.  I also utilize Coda2, Eclipse, Android Studio, Xcode, and Team Foundation when needed but don't utilize it daily to need to customize the client.  To improve my workflow I have many automated plugins that help generate items in my design software and additional apple scripts.
