I know my example dot files are pretty pathetic haha but I haven't done too much configuration recently to my environment. My main development machine used to be a macbook pro and I just used default git commands(no aliases), textmate and the terminal. Even on my Trisquel box now I just use defaults. When I worked in San Fran years ago for ModCloth I used to utilize config files more in that work environment but I just haven't had the need to really customize things. Sorry if that's a lame excuse. :) Also with my latest contract work, I've been stuck in Microsoft land so my life for the past 6+ months has been Visual Studio.

My prefered work environment is using some distro of GNU/Linux, Vim for editing, rbenv for supporting multiple Ruby versions(since I develop in Ruby mostly) and git.
