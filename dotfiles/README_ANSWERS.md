Experienced developers, particularly those working in a Unix environment, tend to prefer
tools which afford a measure of customization. The standard Unix approach of dotfiles to
customize editors, shells, IRC clients, and the like to the developers liking is something
we're interested in.

In this directory, please include (at your option) either:

  a) A sampling of dotfiles or other configuration from your working environment.

  b) A rationale for your lack of same (complete with some description of your
     preferred working environment).
     
I have included the only dotfile that I have actively edited on my machine in the last 
year - .zshrc. 

Beyond terminal, I don't use many programs that lend themselves to dot file 
configuration. My main editor is WebStorm. I also use Atom, Visual Studio Code, 
Sublime Text 3, PhpStorm and, rarely, Xcode. I have setup code snippets in both  
Atom and WebStorm, but have not settled into a consistent use-case. I tend to make 
snippets after repeating myself 3 times or so.
  
I haven't used Vim or Emacs more than few times in my lifetime, but am not 
afraid to learn either. I just haven't gone down that path yet.

For many years, I used a windows environment and therefore relied heavily on Visual 
Studio. I did not use much customized configuration beyond a few tools that I had setup for 
database operations - eg: schema generation and data pulls.
