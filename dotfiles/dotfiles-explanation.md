Attached.  But in all honesty I don't know what I'd end up with.  I'm not trying to sell myself as knowing this, I would really need to learn more to have deep preferences.

I'd start off with Zach Holman's dotfiles and dotfiles.org and modify from there.

My preferred working environment has been Visual Studio.  Sorry, not sexy but I like IDE's.  For the most part I find them very efficient for my brain.  I honestly don't like to have to remember file paths and commands constantly.  I like to save that brain space for my programming tasks.  I'm very fond of most of what JetBrains is doing.  I've used ReSharper in Visual Studio for years.  I really think with the refactoring tools as well as the unit testing it's hard to live without the tools.  I'm using RubyMine and PHPStorm.  I'm finding the repository of Ruby Gems is very good in RubyMine.  PHP integration in PHPStorm is so-so.  It has CoffeeScript, which is very helpful (and translates over python/django as well) but nothing really for Zend or CodeIgniter, though I don't think I'll have any trouble using either in PHPStorm with a little setup.  I've used Eclipse, but I don't spend any time programming Java.  My favorite just go to editor is Notepad++ or Sublime Text 2, sorry Vim, Vi, Emacs.
