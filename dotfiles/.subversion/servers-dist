### This file specifies server-specific protocol parameters,
### including HTTP proxy information, and HTTP timeout settings.
###
### The currently defined server options are:
###   http-proxy-host            Proxy host for HTTP connection
###   http-proxy-port            Port number of proxy host service
###   http-proxy-username        Username for auth to proxy service
###   http-proxy-password        Password for auth to proxy service
###   http-proxy-exceptions      List of sites that do not use proxy
###   http-timeout               Timeout for HTTP requests in seconds
###   http-compression           Whether to compress HTTP requests
###   neon-debug-mask            Debug mask for Neon HTTP library
###   ssl-authority-files        List of files, each of a trusted CAs
###   ssl-trust-default-ca       Trust the system 'default' CAs
###   ssl-client-cert-file       PKCS#12 format client certificate file
###   ssl-client-cert-password   Client Key password, if needed.
###
### HTTP timeouts, if given, are specified in seconds.  A timeout
### of 0, i.e. zero, causes a builtin default to be used.
###
### The commented-out examples below are intended only to
### demonstrate how to use this file; any resemblance to actual
### servers, living or dead, is entirely coincidental.

### In this section, the URL of the repository you're trying to
### access is matched against the patterns on the right.  If a
### match is found, the server info is from the section with the
### corresponding name.

[groups]
# group1 = *.collab.net
# othergroup = repository.blarggitywhoomph.com
# thirdgroup = *.example.com

### Information for the first group:
# [group1]
# http-proxy-host = proxy1.some-domain-name.com
# http-proxy-port = 80
# http-proxy-username = blah
# http-proxy-password = doubleblah
# http-timeout = 60
# neon-debug-mask = 130

### Information for the second group:
# [othergroup]
# http-proxy-host = proxy2.some-domain-name.com
# http-proxy-port = 9000
# No username and password, so use the defaults below.

### You can set default parameters in the 'global' section.
### These parameters apply if no corresponding parameter is set in
### a specifically matched group as shown above.  Thus, if you go
### through the same proxy server to reach every site on the
### Internet, you probably just want to put that server's
### information in the 'global' section and not bother with
### 'groups' or any other sections.
###
### If you go through a proxy for all but a few sites, you can
### list those exceptions under 'http-proxy-exceptions'.  This only
### overrides defaults, not explicitly matched server names.
###
### 'ssl-authority-files' is a semicolon-delimited list of files,
### each pointing to a PEM-encoded Certificate Authority (CA) 
### SSL certificate.  See details above for overriding security 
### due to SSL.
[global]
# http-proxy-exceptions = *.exception.com, www.internal-site.org
# http-proxy-host = defaultproxy.whatever.com
# http-proxy-port = 7000
# http-proxy-username = defaultusername
# http-proxy-password = defaultpassword
# http-compression = no
# No http-timeout, so just use the builtin default.
# No neon-debug-mask, so neon debugging is disabled.
# ssl-authority-files = /path/to/CAcert.pem;/path/to/CAcert2.pem
