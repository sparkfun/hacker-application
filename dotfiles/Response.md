Experienced developers, particularly those working in a Unix environment, tend to prefer
tools which afford a measure of customization. The standard Unix approach of dotfiles to
customize editors, shells, IRC clients, and the like to the developers liking is something
we're interested in.

In this directory, please include (at your option) either:

  a) A sampling of dotfiles or other configuration from your working environment.
  Ans. I am uploading .bash_profile that I use on my mac for setting up path. .netrc file for git and bitbucket credentials for git to user from terminal. I do have /etc/hosts file setup as well for hosts enteries. Please know our deployment and working environment is Windows, but I am using mac for development.

  b) A rationale for your lack of same (complete with some description of your
     preferred working environment).
