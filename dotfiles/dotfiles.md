As far as dot files go, I shamelessly use [Paul Irish's dotfiles](https://github.com/paulirish/dotfiles). Most notably, the following alias settings for easier navigation:

```
# Easier navigation: .., ..., ~ and -
alias ..="cd .."
alias cd..="cd .."
alias ...="cd ../.."
alias ....="cd ../../.."
alias .....="cd ../../../.."
alias ~="cd ~" # `cd` is probably faster to type though
alias -- -="cd -"
```

I cannot begin to tell you how nice it is to not type `cd` 4,000 times a day. Of course, there are a multitude of other time-saving goodies within Paul's dotfiles. Another repo I'd suggest checking out is [Addy Osmani's Dotfiles](https://github.com/addyosmani/dotfiles).

Further, I've used Total Terminal, but have recently switched to iTerm due to breaking changes brought on by El Capitan's system integrity protection.
