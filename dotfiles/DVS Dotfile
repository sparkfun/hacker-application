Sparkfun Github Dotfile Example
Doug Van Scoy
Tuesday, April 5, 2016

Since I am no longer a developer, I am using the following instructions from your Github Readme doc:
Experienced developers, particularly those working in a Unix environment, tend to prefer tools which afford a measure of 
customization. The standard Unix approach of dotfiles to customize editors, shells, IRC clients, and the like to the developers liking
is something we're interested in.

In this directory, please include (at your option) either:
a) A sampling of dotfiles or other configuration from your working environment.
b) A rationale for your lack of same (complete with some description of your preferred working environment).

Rationale for lack of same:  
	I am no longer a developer so this does not apply to me.  However, in my roles in IT management and project management, 
	I utilize tools that allow me a measure of customization.   For example, I use MS Word Templates, Confluence categorization, 
	Excel, Jira, and other tools that allow me to do some customization in what I do.
