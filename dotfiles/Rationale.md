Rationale

I initially learned to develop on a Mac environment using zsh. Most of th customization I used was Oh My Zsh. I recently switched to using a bash shell on my Windows laptop. I am still new to dotfiles, so I opted to research existing .bashrc files to get an idea of what other people were using and I selected the example provided because on the command line it provides information about branch, changes whether staged or unstaged and tracked or untracked, and changes color depending on how I've logged in. 

The aliases at the bottom of the files were my own addition to cut down on typing time.
