I don't usually do any serious coding from the shell, so I've never customized it.
Just lots of mysql monitoring/query explaining.

For serious coding I prefer Notepad++ on Windows and Textmate on Mac.

--------------------------------------------------

Experienced developers, particularly those working in a Unix environment, tend to prefer
tools which afford a measure of customization. The standard Unix approach of dotfiles to
customize editors, shells, IRC clients, and the like to the developers liking is something
we're interested in.

In this directory, please include (at your option) either:

  a) A sampling of dotfiles or other configuration from your working environment.

  b) A rationale for your lack of same (complete with some description of your
     preferred working environment).
