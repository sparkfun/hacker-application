In this folder, I have included some common dotfiles that I use in my local environment.

Here is a glimpse into my current setup.

* MacBook Pro with macOS Sierra
* Homebrew for package management
* Apache/2.4.23 (Unix)
* MariaDB for MySQL and Sequel Pro (GUI)
* multiple versions of PHP (currently 5.6 and 7.1) using sphp
* use php xdebug
* use the command line for git
* use ssh config and sometimes Transmit when I need a GUI
* always use keys over passwords for ssh unless extra security is needed then I use both
* use the Atom editor and in the past I've used Sublime and TextMate
* if ssh is being used, I use Vi/Vim or Nano
* the basic git diff command works for me when I need to compare revisions
* Postman is used quite a bit when working with APIs
* Slack for messaging team members
* For developing websites locally, I recently started using SSL
* LetsEncrypt is used to manage SSL for staging and sometimes production environments
* for the frontend, I have been using Webpack in tangent with Babel (for ES6) to compile assets
* in the past, I have used Grunt and Gulp
