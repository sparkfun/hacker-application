Unfortunately I don't have any dotfiles. :(

I do have a dirty little [php script](http://jameskiefer.com/devtools.php) that
I use frequently.

I am used to using a Windows workstation. Some of my favorite development applications
are Notepad++, WinSCP, Putty, Fiddler, RegexBuddy, BeyondCompare and AgentRansack.
