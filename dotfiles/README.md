Experienced developers, particularly those working in a Unix environment, tend to prefer
tools which afford a measure of customization. The standard Unix approach of dotfiles to
customize editors, shells, IRC clients, and the like to the developers liking is something
we're interested in.

In this directory, please include (at your option) either:

  a) A sampling of dotfiles or other configuration from your working environment.

  b) A rationale for your lack of same (complete with some description of your
     preferred working environment).

  My answer - I believe I've only used .gitignore and .env for dotfiles so far, and these aren't environment files. I don't really have a reason for this, other than the packages available in the Atom editor have meet my needs thus far for customization in my coding environment.

  I use an Atom beautify package that is a quick and easy way to lint code in all of the languages that I'm using while writing, to keep organized. I also use an auto-completion package that completes the syntax of html and javascript after giving it the bare minimum. For example, I type 'for' and press tab, and it gives you a for loop typed out. This is valuable because it decreases errors, saves time, and then when I'm beginning a file and thinking through a problem logically, I can quickly add in boilerplate code as I'm talking through it.

  Finally, I use several other linter packages (one for HTML, one for JavaScript and PHP, and one for CSS) that are more thorough and a great check to insure everything looks how it needs to be. I would be excited to dive more into my .bash_profile and learn more about how to customize my environment even more to be an even more efficient developer. Just another thing I'm excited to learn!
