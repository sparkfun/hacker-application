Experienced developers, particularly those working in a Unix environment, tend to prefer
tools which afford a measure of customization. The standard Unix approach of dotfiles to
customize editors, shells, IRC clients, and the like to the developers liking is something
we're interested in.

In this directory, please include (at your option) either:

  a) A sampling of dotfiles or other configuration from your working environment.

  b) A rationale for your lack of same (complete with some description of your
     preferred working environment).

** Lack of dotfiles **
It's not for lack of trying!

Exactly none of the projects we work on are the same.  A typical project for my company involves us using the host that has been chosen by the client and we may get a dev environment or we may not.  Sometimes we get lucky and the host is really cool like Rackspace.  Other times, we are stuck with a shared host like GoDaddy. And there was this one time we had to redesign a site on Wix... that was not a fun project at all! 

Therefore, we have a reasonable expectation that any given project will most likely NOT allow us to customize the environment or do any work using the command line.
