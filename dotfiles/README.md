Experienced developers, particularly those working in a Unix environment, tend to prefer
tools which afford a measure of customization. The standard Unix approach of dotfiles to
customize editors, shells, IRC clients, and the like to the developers liking is something
we're interested in.

In this directory, please include (at your option) either:

  a) A sampling of dotfiles or other configuration from your working environment.

  b) A rationale for your lack of same (complete with some description of your
     preferred working environment).


William Barstad's answer:

My bash dotfile has no mods to it. I prefer using an IDE for development. My favorite for PHP development is PHPStorm, with integrated support for databases, repositories, console, Composer, Vagrant, debugging and much more. I like repeatable processes, standardization, community-supported components, "code that writes code" (Like PHPDoc) and using any tool that can help get the job done. I am less interested in 'reinventing the wheel' to resolve an issue and rather tend to reach out to see how others have resolved the same issue. On the other hand, I feel great satisfaction when I discover the best way to resolve a new issue or requirement, or discover new functionality that may be useful to my users.
