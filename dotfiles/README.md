Experienced developers, particularly those working in a Unix environment, tend to prefer
tools which afford a measure of customization. The standard Unix approach of dotfiles to
customize editors, shells, IRC clients, and the like to the developers liking is something
we're interested in.

In this directory, please include (at your option) either:

  a) A sampling of dotfiles or other configuration from your working environment.

  b) A rationale for your lack of same (complete with some description of your
     preferred working environment).
     
I examined the git repo and found the position descriptions for the “Full Stack Developer” and the “Web Developer Student Intern,” both created a year ago. I did not find instructions for a Software Development Manager; however, I did note that the Development Project Manager and Director of Information Technology also utilize this repository. It is unclear to me how I should proceed. I want to answer every question thoroughly and to the best of my ability.
I do not have a preferred working environment. I am very comfortable with Unix and Windows tools as I have used them more recently.  As long as the tools are adequate to the job and do not create any hindrance to the task, I will not dictate the tools a developer uses. If a developer can efficiently write code in Notepad and the results work correctly, I will not interfere.
However, if the selected tools prove inadequate, it is my job as a manager to help direct the team to find and use tools that will be up to the task.
