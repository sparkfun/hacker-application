Experienced developers, particularly those working in a Unix environment, tend to prefer
tools which afford a measure of customization. The standard Unix approach of dotfiles to
customize editors, shells, IRC clients, and the like to the developers liking is something
we're interested in.

In this directory, please include (at your option) either:

  a) A sampling of dotfiles or other configuration from your working environment.

  b) A rationale for your lack of same (complete with some description of your
     preferred working environment).

## My Answer

In my current setup I am not utilizing dotfiles, however I have used them before. Previously, when performing wireless experiments in graduate school, I had to build Linux boxes to act as nodes in the network. For this setup, I had the Linux installation and all required programs auto-install when os was run from the usb-dongle.

My preferred setup varies depending on the project. I like having access to both Windows and Unix (Ubuntu) without rebooting, and I run the least used OS on a virtual machine. In graduate school, I required to use Ubuntu more heavily due to experiments and paper writing on Latex, thus I ran windows on virtual machine. I also like having access to different versions of a software or programming language, for example in my current setup I have access to both Python 3.5 and Python 2.7. Having the flexibility to quickly test on various OS and different language versions is more important to me than tweaking my system appearance.
