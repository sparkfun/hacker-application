Experienced developers, particularly those working in a Unix environment, tend to prefer
tools which afford a measure of customization. The standard Unix approach of dotfiles to
customize editors, shells, IRC clients, and the like to the developers liking is something
we're interested in.

In this directory, please include (at your option) either:

  a) A sampling of dotfiles or other configuration from your working environment.

  b) A rationale for your lack of same (complete with some description of your
     preferred working environment).

My preferred working environment these days is the Atom editor. It's GUI.
So, I'm including the config file for that. Before I found Atom, I used Brackets, and before that Notepad++ on Windows and TextWrangler on Mac.

I would like to create my own custom syntax theme, maybe even my own custom monospaced font to go with it- but as the existing themes are tolerable, doing that is such a low priority compared to other things that I should be doing whenever the text editor is open that I have to file it under 'procrastination projects.'
