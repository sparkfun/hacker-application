Experienced developers, particularly those working in a Unix environment, tend to prefer
tools which afford a measure of customization. The standard Unix approach of dotfiles to
customize editors, shells, IRC clients, and the like to the developers liking is something
we're interested in.

In this directory, please include (at your option) either:

  a) A sampling of dotfiles or other configuration from your working environment.

  b) A rationale for your lack of same (complete with some description of your
     preferred working environment).

     I have not customized any of my dot files. I use atom as my editor which has many packages to download for customization. I use OhMyZsh for my shell. As for IRC clients, never used one... I am a fan of slack. I don't have any reason why I have not played with dot files, I guess I never felt the need. So many things to learn.
