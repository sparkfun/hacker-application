We observe that the experienced nerd often prefers tools which afford a measure
of customization, and that most hackers accrue some amount of configuration for
editors, shells, IRC clients, and the like.

In this directory, please include (at your option) either:

  a) A collection of dotfiles or other configuration from your working
     environment.

  b) A rationale for your lack of same (complete with some description
     of your preferred working environment).

---------------------------------------------

I've tried as best as possible to keep my dev environment as "vanilla" as possible. I did QA for a while before getting into development and those "test test test" quirks still stick with me. I have found that leaving my environment as "natural" as possible has caused the least problems when I push my code to a different environment.

I use Sublime Text 2 as it is a very fast loading and fully featured editor. I use the terminal, filezilla/cyberduck, and github to interact with servers.
