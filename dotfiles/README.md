We observe that the experienced nerd often prefers tools which afford a measure
of customization, and that most hackers accrue some amount of configuration for
editors, shells, IRC clients, and the like.

In this directory, please include (at your option) either:

  a) A collection of dotfiles or other configuration from your working
     environment.

  b) A rationale for your lack of same (complete with some description
     of your preferred working environment).

I currently develop in a Windows environment as I use Visual Studio, SQL Server Management Studio, and other Windows only tools quite often.  I understand a lot of software has equivalents that run under Linux.

Currently my working environment is like so:
	Putty I use to SSH into servers.
	Notepad++ and Sublime I use for php and other generic text editing tasks.
	SQLyog I use for most MySQL tasks.
	AptDiff I use for comparing files.
