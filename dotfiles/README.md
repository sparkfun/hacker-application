Experienced developers, particularly those working in a Unix environment, tend to prefer
tools which afford a measure of customization. The standard Unix approach of dotfiles to
customize editors, shells, IRC clients, and the like to the developers liking is something
we're interested in.

In this directory, please include (at your option) either:

  a) A sampling of dotfiles or other configuration from your working environment.

  b) A rationale for your lack of same (complete with some description of your
     preferred working environment).

	 
Option B:
As I primarily develop on a Windows box, I'll just describe my development environment:
Editor: Notepad++ - it's lightweight, allows a jillion windows to be open at once and has support for some helpful plugins (XDebug specifically)
FTP: FileZilla
SSH/Telnet: PuTTY
File Browser/Management: Q-Dir
Office/Productivity: Google's online suite, OpenOffice if Google fails
Database Work: MySQL Workbench/Tools for diagram/planning, HeidiSQL for a GUI
Local WAMPstack: Bitnami WAMPstack 7.0.x, have used WAMPserver and XAMPP in the past as well
Dual monitors is *extremely* helpful.
