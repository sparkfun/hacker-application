Experienced developers, particularly those working in a Unix environment, tend to prefer
tools which afford a measure of customization. The standard Unix approach of dotfiles to
customize editors, shells, IRC clients, and the like to the developers liking is something
we're interested in.

In this directory, please include (at your option) either:

  a) A sampling of dotfiles or other configuration from your working environment.

    >I added my .bash_profile to this directory. Among other things, this is where
    I customize the appearance of my bash prompt.

    ![My terminal](./terminal.png?raw=true "Terminal prompt customizations")

  b) A rationale for your lack of same (complete with some description of your
     preferred working environment).

![My terminal](./terminal.png?raw=true "Terminal prompt customizations")
