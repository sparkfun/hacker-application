The 3 Essential add-on's I'm using right now for VS

Resharper - It cleans your code, it tells you better ways to do things and has all sorts of helpful features. The "Goto Implementation" feature
	    justifies the cost of this tool alone.

Web Essentials - Free add-on that basically just makes writing CSS and HTML a little easier

Visual Studio Achievments by Channel9 - Because nothing is better than opening up the war-torn remains of a client's code and seeing an 
	achievement pop up in the bottom right corner of VS that says "Job Security - Write 20 single letter class level variables in one file. Kudos to you for being cryptic!"




We only used basic Eclipse, PHPMyAdmin, and Putty when I was working with PHP at Blistt so I can't really give an opinion on it.
