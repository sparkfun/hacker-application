b) A rationale for your lack of same (complete with some description
     of your preferred working environment).

My experience with dot files has been with Dropbox only, and a little bit with Perl, and customizing VI.

I currently work remote on a live server with Coda2, Linux (Fedora), SSH via terminal, VIM for updating my server.

My preferred working environment has been solely based on my previous experience. I have never worked in a large developing environment, but that said, I am very adaptable to change and learning new things.
