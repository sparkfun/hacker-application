For my preferred working environment I use 'Notepad++' with the NppFTP plugin when working on Windows OS. When working on a Macintosh OS I prefer to use either 'Coda' or the free text editor 'Text Wrangler.' When working on a Unix OS such as Ubuntu or CentOS I prefer to use 'VIM', the command line editor. I prefer to use the standard settings for each of these working environments, simply because that's just what has always worked best for me.
