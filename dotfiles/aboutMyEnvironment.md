Shell (see .zshrc):

I use zsh for my primary shell and atom for my primary text editor.  Zsh comes with a lot of extended functionality and customization over bash.  My usage of it is fairly standard.  I have added the git plugin to better visualize what is happening with git.  I have set atom as my default editor, installed node version manager, and have set up a virtual environment for working with python.

Editor:

Atom is my primary text editor and I have some very helpful packages installed.   I use atom-beautify to auto format my code when saving.   This makes code more readable and keeps things organized.  I use a linter to direct my attention to potential syntactical flaws in my code.  I also use the files-icon package to make visualization of file types much easier.  Additionally, I use auto-complete packages for a variety of different languages.  Using these auto-complete packages has become second nature when I am typing.  They reduce development time and make it easier for me to get thoughts out of my head and into code.
