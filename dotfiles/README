We observe that the experienced nerd often prefers tools which afford a measure
of customization, and that most hackers accrue some amount of configuration for
editors, shells, IRC clients, and the like.

In this directory, please include (at your option) either:

  a) A collection of dotfiles or other configuration from your working
     environment.
    
    Oops!  I've been working in Windows so I have no dotFiles!
    
  b) A rationale for your lack of same.  Responses will be evaluated for
     both style and content.
     
       Until recently in TextPad using Firebug as my main html/javascript debugger. I always use a light on 
     dark theme, so I would modify TextPad's default colorations.
       More recently, I've tossed TextPad out the window for major code projects because I discovered Aptana 
     Studio, which is based on Eclipse (Studio 3.0 beta to be exact). I exclusively use Aptana for Ruby and PHP.  
     Aptana's default colors (white on black), syntax highlighting, code snippets, and git integration 
     make it powerful enough that I haven't had to make many changes.  However I have dug in and discovered 
     that when I decide to add my own snippets and whatnot, adding them will be easy and fast.
     
       As far as that dreaded Windows comment above, sadly it is true.  I've spent most of
     my computer time in a Microsoft world.  Fortunately, I've been converted to Fedora 14. I have been using
     it much more as my web server and development platform (LAMP style), and I'm in the midst of getting my 
     windows partition running as a Virtual Machine on Fedora. When coding in linux I use Vim and Eclipse.
