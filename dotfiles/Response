Experienced developers, particularly those working in a Unix environment, tend to prefer tools which afford a measure of customization. 
The standard Unix approach of dotfiles to customize editors, shells, IRC clients, and the like to the developers liking is something 
we're interested in.

In this directory, please include a rationale for your lack of same (complete with some description of your preferred working environment).

  I believe ".gitignore" is the only dot-file I've ever used. I'm not partial to a Unix environment as many developers are.
As a game developer, I've found Microsoft Windows to be my preferred platform. With tools such as Unity3D freely available and
capable of importing custom extensions to meet my needs, I've never had to look elsewhere.
  Customization can be important though. If a system or tool is not meeting your needs, having the ability to create your own or utilize 
someone else's existing modification can be an incredible time-saver.
