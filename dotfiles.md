While I have some experience working with dot files to configure my environment, I believe I have room to grow in knowledge of how to properly use them. I have used dot files to configure project settings such as omniauth keys and secrets to keep them from being committed to my GitHub repositories. My preferred working environment consists of OSX, Atom, and Bash in combination with Git.
