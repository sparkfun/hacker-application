SparkFun Electronics Hacker Application
=======================================

[SparkFun Electronics](http://www.sparkfun.com) is *always* on the lookout for developers skilled in the a modern Unix-based web stack. Development projects vary wildly from pushing the boundaries of user experience for our forward-facing websites to building sophisticated internal web-based applications for running the business.

How to Apply
------------

1. Fork this repository.
2. On your fork, modify / add to the repository per the instruction in the README files for each of the four top-level directories.
3. Issue a pull request for your changes back to [sparkfun/hacker-application](https://github.com/sparkfun/hacker-application).

Your pull request is your application.

What Happens to Your Pull Request
---------------------------------

Your pull request will *never* be merged (to keep this repository open for everyone who follows you). When you've either been hired or declined your pull request will simply be closed.

During the review process you may find comments applied to your pull request - asking questions, seeking clarification, a rogue compliment, etc.

Legal Stuff Regarding Your Pull Request
---------------------------------------

**No content from your pull request will be used by SparkFun Electronics for any purpose other than assessing the quality of a given applicant.**

We won't rip off your code. You retain copyright on any pull request you submit.

However, by submitting a pull request, you affirm that the content within is solely your original work. Content generated collaboratively with other individuals must be identified as such and content generated entirely by other individuals should not be included. Failure to meet these guidelines may result in disqualification as an applicant.

Levels of Employment
====================

Full Time Web Application Developer
-----------------------------------

Full time web application developer positions at SparkFun are 40 hours a week and are salaried, not hourly positions.

All developer positions, presently, require physical presence at our office in Boulder, CO. Working remotely is afforded as a benefit to established developers and is generally not extended to new hires immediately. If you wish to apply and live elsewhere, be prepared to relocate.

Web Application Developer Internship
------------------------------------

We do offer paid internships to the right applicants. The process to apply is the same as for full time employment - follow the instructions above.

Interns would primarily get their feet wet by assisting with quality assurance and code review as well as being assigned low-level bugs and tweaks to pull their weight right from the start. Ultimately, after cultivating trust by producing quality work, small-scale refactoring of existing submodules and the development of wholly new small-scale submodules would be assigned, providing interns with atomic projects that provide solid experience while directly benefiting SparkFun. Interns will learn modern collaborative web development, version control, and code review with professionals.

Our internship program is flexible. Compensation and hours may vary greatly based on skills, experience, and availability. In general we look for interns that can work at least 20 hours a week with the ability to work a full 40 hour week for parts of the year (e.g. when not in school).
