SparkFun Electronics Hacker Application
=======================================

[SparkFun Electronics](http://www.sparkfun.com) is *always* on the lookout for developers skilled in the a modern Unix-based web stack. Development projects vary wildly from pushing the boundaries of user experience for our forward-facing websites to building sophisticated internal web-based applications for running the business to crafting a massive suite of automated testing for our continuous integration environment.

How to Apply
------------

1. Fork this repository.
2. On your fork, modify / add to the repository per the instruction in the README files for each of the four top-level directories.
3. Issue a pull request for your changes back to [sparkfun/hacker-application](https://github.com/sparkfun/hacker-application).

Your pull request is your application.

What Happens to Your Pull Request
---------------------------------

Your pull request will *never* be merged (to keep this repository open for everyone who follows you). When you've either been hired or declined your pull request will simply be closed.

During the review process you may find comments applied to your pull request - asking questions, seeking clarification, a rogue compliment, etc.

Positions and Levels of Employment
==================================

Full Time Web Application Developer
-----------------------------------

**Status: <span color="#990000">not currently hiring</span>**

Full time **web application developer** positions at SparkFun are 40 hours a week and are salaried, not hourly positions.

All developer positions, presently, require physical presence at our office in Boulder, CO. Working off-site is afforded as a benefit to established developers and only on an ad hoc basis (a few days a month, for example). If you wish to apply and live elsewhere, be prepared to relocate.

Full Time Web App Test Developer
--------------------------------

**Status: <span color="#009900">NOW HIRING!</span>**

Full time **test developer** positions at SparkFun are 40 hours a week and are salaried, not hourly positions.

Test developers focus on building a comprehensive suite of automated tests for everything the developer group creates. Test developers *are* developers in that they work in the same group and participate in code review and collaborative development much the same as the developers. The only difference is *what* they are building all day.

Web Application Developer Internship
------------------------------------

**Status: <span color="#990000">not currently hiring</span>**

We do offer paid internships to the right applicants. The process to apply is the same as for full time employment - follow the instructions above.

Interns would primarily get their feet wet by assisting with quality assurance and code review as well as being assigned low-level bugs and tweaks to pull their weight right from the start. Ultimately, after cultivating trust by producing quality work, small-scale refactoring of existing submodules and the development of wholly new small-scale submodules would be assigned, providing interns with atomic projects that provide solid experience while directly benefiting SparkFun. Interns will learn modern collaborative web development, version control, and code review with professionals.

Our internship program is flexible. Compensation and hours may vary greatly based on skills, experience, and availability. In general we look for interns that can work at least 20 hours a week with the ability to work a full 40 hour week for parts of the year (e.g. when not in school).
