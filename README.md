## About this repository

This repository is intended for applicants to positions in the IT Department of [SparkFun Electronics](https://www.sparkfun.com), including Full Stack Developer, Web Developer Student Intern, Development Project Manager, and Director of Information Technology. This repository is a standard way by which candidates demonstrate basic distributed version control skills, provide code samples, and answer more in-depth questions.

Typically an applicant will come in by a job post on one of many job boards with little more than a resume and cover letter. Applicants who look viable on paper will be invited to a brief phone screen that includes an initial technical assessment. Well-qualified applicants will then be invited to fork and complete this repository in advance of an in-person interview.

Ambitious applicants can set themselves apart by taking the initiative to complete this repository before being invited to do so.

## How to use this repository

1. Fork this repository.
2. Follow the instructions in the `README` files contained within each top level directory.
3. Send a pull request back to SparkFun.

Note that pull requests can either be sent back to the main repository or you can create a branch on your fork and create a pull request into master on your fork. The latter method requires that you contact your contacts in the hiring process (or, if you're submitting a pull req uninvited, the management of the SparkFun IT department) with a link to your pull request. Use the latter method if you prefer some degree of anonymity.

### What Happens To Your Pull Request

Your pull request will *never* be merged (to keep this repository open for the applicants that use it after you). When you've either been hired or declined your pull request will simply be closed.

During the review process you may find comments applied to your pull request - asking questions, seeking clarification, a rogue compliment, etc.

### Legal Stuff Regarding Your Pull Request

**No content from your pull request will be used by SparkFun Electronics for any purpose other than assessing the quality of a given applicant.**

We won't rip off your code. You retain copyright on any pull request you submit.

However, by submitting a pull request, you affirm that the content within is solely your original work. Content generated collaboratively with other individuals must be identified as such and content generated entirely by other individuals should not be included. Failure to meet these guidelines may result in disqualification as an applicant.
