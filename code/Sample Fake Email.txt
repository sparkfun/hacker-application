To All Employees

I wanted to share with you the recent developments within the photo industry and how we will be adjusting our mobile strategy to position ourselves for success.  The zombie apocalypse is upon us and digital photography will be on a rapid decline within the next few months as the zombies move from the east to the west coast.  Millions of people will be affected by these recent events and survival of the human race will be of importance to everyone.  Survival gear such as weapons, food, shelter, and transportation demand is at an all time high therefore we feel this is the best opportunity for us to align our strategy to meet the growing needs of our customers.

Effective Monday morning, our mobile focus will be to create survival products that we can control or enhance with the use of mobile devices.  Our teams have already begun work on a few working prototypes that we will be testing in the upcoming weeks.  They include the following and their preliminary specifications:

	Zombie Killer Drone
	-controlled via iOS or Android.  No Support for windows users.  The engineers felt those customers didn't deserve it.
	-shoot zombies from within phone screen with laser precision.
	-8 hour battery with in-flight charging via solar panels.
	-shoot up to 2 targets.
	
	
	Zombie utility knife phone case
	-the swiss army knife built into a phone case.
	-5 uses (knife, scissors, phillips, sharp needle, saw)
	-made from the finest aircraft aluminum.
	
If anyone has additional questions or would like to help testing our new products, please feel free to contact me via email or by phone.


Thanks
