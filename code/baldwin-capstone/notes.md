I included the main page of my capstone project in this folder and then just the related files to this one page in it's path to the backend. The full project can be found at the link below.

(see video there, too!)

I'm very proud of this robust, full-stack project - it is an e-commerce app, complete with a shopping cart functionality where users can buy their food and then Twilio's SMS text messaging service will send them a text message once the meal is ready. During checkout, Stripe's credit card authorization service does all the heavy lifting. Then, there's a login for the restaurant entities who post their leftover purchasable food in this app, so they can interact with their 'internal system page' where they can view all of their orders and also meals that are available for purchase.

I love e-commerce systems and I really know the value of great and efficient internal systems, and I believe this project and the one page sample I provided demonstrates how I'm a great fit for the SparkFun position. Thanks!
