# CSS/SCSS

In this directory you will find a .scss file. I figured this would be more applicable in terms of showing you how I work because I almost always use a compiler now. It allows for better organization and reusability of code. If you need an example of pure css, let me know and I would be glad to send you something.

This file also corresponds to the include file in the html directory. It's representative of how I work, being that I use modules for almost everything.
