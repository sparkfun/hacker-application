<h2> <a href=http://localhost:2540/mimer-data.xyz> mimer-data.xyz </a> </h2>
<p>

<h2> Pressing on the above link will enact the following: </h2>

<ol> 

<li> MyWebServer, running on localhost:2540, will retrieve the five lines of data
from mimer-data.xyz.
<li> MyWebServer will send back the MIME header [Content-Type:
application/xyz] along with the five lines of data.
<li> This browser will look up the MIME type and recognize that it has
a handler, <i> shim.bat</i>, registered to handle this kind of data. (This
registration was previously performed by editing the Windows Registry, and
also by associating the .xyz file type through Windows Explorer.)

<li> This browser will write the five lines of data to a temporary file
somewhere in a windows temporary internet folder.

<li> This browser will call shim.bat, and pass the name of the temporary
data file to it as argument one.

<li> This browser now considers the data handled, and is done, and will
likely hang, unless some (not required) provision for, e.g., a multipart
MIME type is made. Usually the temporary data file will later be removed
by the browser as a last step.

<li> If the browser asks if you want to "Open" or "Download" the file,
be sure to uncheck the box, when you are ready, that says "always ask me."
Otherwise just say you want to open the file.

<li> Shim.bat will be invoked, and passed the name of the temporary data
file. The "pause" will freeze the DOS script so that you can check the
status of shim.bat. Press enter to continue.

<li> Shim.bat will call java.exe, which in turn will load <i>
BCHandler.class </i>
and pass the name of the data file to it as part of the execution
environment invoked by shim.bat.

<li> BCHandler will extract the name of the temporary data file from
an environment variable, open the file, and read in the lines of data,
placing them in symbolic memory under program control.

<li> BCHandler will write out an XML version of the data (just so we can see
it working locally), and then send the XML version of the data to
MyWebServer's back channel looper, which is listening at port 2570.

<li> MyWebServer will display both the XML verion and normal symbolic string
data version of the five lines of data on the MyWebServer console.

</ul>
