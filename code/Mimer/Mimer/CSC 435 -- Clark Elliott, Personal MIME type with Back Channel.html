<h1> Program Three</h1>

<h2> Personal MIME type generation and handler</h2>

</center>


<h3> Required: Firefox browser </h3>

Note: post bug reports, and OSX/Linux suggestions to the newsgroup, and I'll make updates here.<p>

</p><h2> Overview: </h2>

Copy and complete the <a href="http://condor.depaul.edu/elliott/435/hw/programs/checklist-mimer.html"> checklist.html </a> file.<p>

In this program we will use the Web to establish <i> back channel </i>
communication between a server machine and client machine. This powerful
construct allows us a simple initial interface, with yet unconstrained
communication between the server and client as a result.</p><p>

Along the way we will also implement synchronous and asynchronous calls,
read environment variables, create our own personal MIME types, serve that
MIME type data from our MyWebServer programs, write a client-side handler
program to handle data of that MIME type, and create our own protocol to
serialize (marshal) and restore data in XML format sent over the network.</p><p>


You will write a simple <i> handler </i> program, called by the browser, to
handle your personal MIME data on the client. You will associate your own
handler with the MIME data in the browser by creating an association between
the MIME type and your program that handles that kind of MIME data. In this
way you will cause client-side execution of a program to process the data
returned from the server. This client-side handler program, in turn, will
marshal the data into XML format and send it back to the server machine
through a back-channel communication link. Lastly, the server will unmarshal
the data from XML and restore it to symbolic form under program control. </p><p>

The amount of <i> required </i> programming for this assignment is
minimal. Additionally, much of the nasty working out of details has been
done for you. However, your computer will be set up differently from the way
others' computers are set up, and thus it is not possible to work out <i>
all </i> the problematic details. In addition, Windows, and Windows Java
implementations, are notoriously annoying and buggy when it comes to what
<i> should </i> be very straightforward procedures to make entries in MIME
tables, set classpaths for compilation and execution, and invoke executable
programs. Thus, you should <i> expect </i> to run into some difficulties,
you should <i> expect </i> java, java classpaths, and Windows (if you are
using it) to act in ways that they should not. There will be no whining
about this being hard, because we cannot rewrite Windows, and the results of
this assignment are worth it. You must leave time for some
experimentation. You should expect to have to look up some solutions on the
web. I have designed the assignment so that you can see success
in the pieces of it, individually, even if you cannot get the whole sequence
working together.</p><p>

This program can be written for OsX and Linux systems as well, and in many
ways will be easier. Instructions here will be for Windows, but see the
special tips for your operating system, and share ideas at the newsgroup forum.</p><p>

Grading: The grading for this assignment will be based largely on your
<strong> write-up </strong> and your <strong> comments </strong>. These can
be based on the individual parts, even if you do not get them all working
together. So, substantial credit is still possible.</p><p>

It will be quite satisfying if you are able to get the whole sequence
of calls working together. However, there are tiny bugs that may frustrate
you. Each of the steps can also be run manually, so be <i> sure </i> that
you turn in running code for each of the individual steps, no matter
what. If you cannot get them all coordinated, say so, but do not give up on
the rest of the assignment!</p><p>

</p><h2> Discussion: </h2> 

This assignment illustrates several powerful concepts: <ol> <li> Your server
is initiating <i> call-back </i> processing on the client. While we are
using a somewhat restricted flavor here, the idea of call-backs, wherein the
server initiates program execution on the client, is one of the pillars of
asychronous communication between client and server.<p>

</p></li><li> At the end of this assignment you will have all the basic tools for
implementing your own MIME type in the real world. This will allow you to
write client applications (e.g., Windows Programs) that process your own
kind of data with your own programs, served over the web. This is how, for
example, RealAudio got started. <i> Powerful tool number one. </i><p>

</p></li><li> You will have all the tools for using the Web as an <i> introduction
</i> device to open <i> back channel </i> communication between a server and
a client. In this useful model you use the strong, simple, and
well-understood search mechanisms of the Web for clients to locate services,
and then seamlessly open a (possibly proprietary) connection at some other
agreed-upon endpoints (ports) between the client and server for the real
processing to take place. <i> Powerful tool number two. </i> <p>

</p></li><li> Many modern platform models include the use of XML as a marshalled form
of data. This includes Web Services, which many consider to be strategic. At
the end of the assignment you will have the basic tools for converting data
stored in symbolic form in memory to a serialized XML format both on
disk, and also sent over the network, and <strong> restored to symbolic form on the
other side. </strong> <i> Powerful tool number three. </i><p>

</p></li></ol>

<h2> The assignment steps: </h2> 

<ul> 
<li> Step One: Return a personal MIME type header (you make it up) from your
webserver so that it triggers client-side handler
<ol>
<li> Install mimer-data.xyz file in your MyWebServer directory.
</li><li> Modify MyWebServer so that it returns an "application/xyz" MIME header
for files with type ".xyz"
</li><li> Write and install your shim.bat script file to run on Windows
</li><li> Modify browser settings to call shim.bat (with a pause) and parse arg
one as the temporary data file name
</li></ol><br>

</li><li> Step Two: Write your Java Handler that reads environment variables, and call it
from server, through shim.bat
<ol>
<li> Create five lines of data on server, put it in a file with extension .xyz
</li><li> Write the simple client-side java handler program for the .xyz data
</li><li> Call java from the shim.bat file
</li><li> Initiate call of client-side java from server on web request of
.xyz file, through the shim
</li><li> Display the name of the temp data file
</li></ol><br>

</li><li> Step Three: Write BCClient Java to serialize data to XML

<ol>
<li> Install the Xstream jar files in your file system
</li><li> Create .bat files to compile and to run with Xstream
</li><li> Write the Java program to write XML output to file
</li></ol> <br>

</li><li>  Step Four: Create the BackChannel communication between your handler
and server.

<ol> 
<li> Add the "admin looper" from your JokeServer to your webserver to
accept connections at port 2570</li><li> Modify the admin looper so that it reads and displays an XML stream
</li><li> Modify your BCClient so that it sends the XML stream to server at
port 2570
</li><li> Run the server, connect to it with BCClient, and show output
</li></ol><br> 

</li><li> Step Five: Combine your two Java programs
<ol> 
<li> See <a href="http://condor.depaul.edu/elliott/435/hw/programs/mimer/mimer-call.html"> mimer-call.html </a> for an overview.
</li><li> Combine BCClient.java and Handler.java into BCHandler.java
</li><li> Run BCHandler standalone from the shim, pass dummy data file as arg one:<br>
    &gt; Connect to server, print the contents of a data file.
</li><li> Call the server from a browser, requesting the data file of that application/xyz MIME
type, based on file extension of .xyz.<br>

&gt; Load <a href="http://condor.depaul.edu/elliott/435/hw/programs/mimer/mimer-call.html"> mimer-call.html </a> into
MyWebServer's root directory by viewing the source and saving.<br>
&gt; Return five lines of data with personal MIME header application/xyz <br>
&gt; Call the handler, via the .bat shim, and pass the temporary data file name<br>
&gt; Serialize the data into XML, write to file (for a local check of XML data) <br>
&gt; Send the data (as XML) to the server through the back channel<br>
&gt;  Display the XML data on the server console.<br>
</li></ol><br>


</li><li> Step Six: Optional bragging rights -- NOT required.
<ol> 
<li> Modify the client so that it uses the MIME data to configure the
backchannel communication. E.g., line one might have "server=140.192.1.2
Port=45362" specifying where the client should connect.
</li><li> Modify Client and Server to use a very general form of data
wrt. length, type, and so forth, taking advantage of Xstream's powerful
marshaling capabilities. (You will have to handle the reading and writing 
of unspecified data to the backchannel communication socket.)
</li><li> Modify Client and Server to use Xstream's mapping capabilities to make
the XML more readable.
</li><li> The XML has been written to disk. This means that the data is
persistent, and it is not necessary for the backchannel server to be running
at the time the BCHandler is running. Instead you can use a persistent
communication scheme where at a <i> later time </i> the backchannel server
starts up, notifies a utility program that it is ready for the data, and
then receives it.
</li><li> etc.
</li></ol>

Note: you might also have to fool with different editors, and line-end
characters to view this / get this to work on / your platform. out.println
may work differently than out.append, \r\n will be different from \n,
Wordpad may add or remove linened characters, and so on.</p><p>




</p><h2> Administration: </h2>


<ul>

<li> Because there is not much coding to do, this assignment will be
graded primarily on how well you demonstrate, in your BCHandler.java
COMMENTS, and in your writeup, how well you understand how
this set of programs works.<p>

</p></li><li> Submission files: checklist.html, mimer-discussion.html,
serverlog.txt showing the connections made to the server and display of the
returned data, and [Handler.java,
BCClient.java, BCHandler.java, (modified) MyWebServer.java with your
EXTENSIVE COMMENTS in the java source code for the BCHandler.java file.]<p>

</p></li><li> Copy and complete the <a href="http://condor.depaul.edu/elliott/435/hw/programs/checklist-mimer.html"> checklist.html </a>
file.<p>

</p></li><li> Most important: Complete mimer-discussion.html which is, essentially, a
narrative of your progress and work on this assignment. What you did, in
what order, what worked, what did not, showing how this all fits together,
and demonstrating not only your good faith efforts, but also your
understanding of all the details. If you did NOT quite get it all running
together, you will need bettter documentation, and a longer discussion
demonstrating that you got all the concepts. I am thinking one page for
running mimers, and two pages for non-fully-running mimers.<p>

</p></li><li> Submit all your mimer files to D2L before the due date (but we don't
need BCClient.java or Handler.java because they are combined in BCHandler).
<p>


</p></li><li> NOTE: If you did not get this fully running, carefully describe all the
good-faith steps that you took in your writeup. For example, you should be
able to get BCClient.java communicating with your server, standalone. You should
be able to get Handler.java called by your shim file, standalone. You
might have some success with the .bat files, but not with the browser. You might
be able to run the handler, but not able to work out the XML. Each of these
can be documented as an independent step, and if you want (possibly
substantial) partial credit, then you must have top-quality
documentation.<p>

</p></li></ul>

<h2> Overview of how MIME types work on the Web: </h2>

<ul> 

<li> The Web client requests a file with a certain file extension.

</li><li> The server looks at the file extension of the requested file, looks up the
MIME type, sends the MIME header back to the client, and then sends the
data.

</li><li> The browser looks at the MIME type, and if it cannot handle it itself,
looks in a table to see who DOES handle this type of data.

</li><li> The browser then throws out the header, writes the data to a temporary
file with a throw-away name, calls the handler program as a subprocess, passes
the name of the temporary file as the first argument to the handler, and
then reliquishes all responsibility for further handling of the data.

</li><li> The handler program, after being invoked by the browser, looks at its
first argument, assumes it is a file name, opens the file, reads in the
data, and processes it (i.e., "handles it") in whatever way it has been
programmed to process it.

</li><li> So, you need to invent a MIME type, invent a data format, create some
data, assign a file type to that data and associated MIME type in your
server, write a handler to handle that kind of data on the client, and associate the
handler with the MIME type in your browser.

</li></ul>

<h2> Developing steps One through Six </h2>

<h3> Step one: Return personal MIME type header so that it triggers
client-side handler. </h3> 

<ol> 

<li> Make a suitable work subdirectory in which to run your MyWebServer.
It is better if this directory is not too deep, because you will be
copying this directory path many times.

</li><li> Make sure that your MyWebServer program is alive and well. If you
did not get it fully running you will have to hack at it to at least return
the specified MIME header and the five lines of data from the file. [Note
that you can write a much simpler java program, based on InetServer, that
just ALWAYS returns the specified MIME header and the five lines of data
directly from the program when a connection is made to port 2540.]

</li><li> Copy the <a href="http://condor.depaul.edu/elliott/435/hw/programs/mimer/mimer-data.xyz.txt"> mimer-data.xyz </a> file
and save it to your MyWebServer's root directory as mimer-data.xyz.

</li><li> Copy the <a href="http://condor.depaul.edu/elliott/435/hw/programs/mimer/shim.bat.txt"> shim.bat </a> file and
save it to your server's root directory. Run this DOS batch file
to make sure it works [Windows start | run | cmd |&gt; cd to directory |&gt; shim]
See, e.g., <a href="http://www.atarimagazines.com/compute/issue137/S20_How_to_write_DOS_bat.php">
How to write DOS Batch Files </a>, or refer to the web.

</li><li> See "<a href="http://condor.depaul.edu/elliott/435/hw/programs/program-mimer.html#assocmime">Associating your MIME type with a handler</a>" (below) to associate the mime type [Content-Type: application/xyz] with
shim.bat. This step might take three minutes, or it might take several
frustrating hours. Be patient. Use the newsgroup. Work carefully.<p>

In my experience Windows sometimes behaves badly on this step. Sometimes it
seems to cache (??) old copies of handlers (in our case shim.bat) and run
those instead of the new versions. If this happens to you, then rename
shim.bat to shim2.bat, and so on, and just re-register the .xyz file type in
Windows Explorer.</p><p>

You also can use the search function in regedit (the registry editor) for
"shim.bat". You may end up having to manually change the value for:<br>

MyComputer,HKEY_CURRENT_USER,<br>
Software,Classes,Applications,shim.bat,shell,open,command<br>

and set it to point to your desired shim.bat file.</p><p>


</p></li><li> Note that even though Windows <i> finds </i> your shim.bat file in
your MyWebServer execution directory, that does not mean that it will start
execution there. On my system, for example, the browser will always start
DOS shim files in the desktop directory, no matter where the executable .bat
file lives. So, use "cd" in your .bat files as needed to navigate to
the directory where your Java handler lives.

</li><li> See <a href="http://condor.depaul.edu/elliott/435/hw/programs/program-mimer.html#mime-server"> Sending the MIME type data from your
server </a> (below) to get your server sending back the correct
application/xyz MIME type.

</li><li> Save the <a href="http://condor.depaul.edu/elliott/435/hw/programs/mimer/mimer-call.html"> mimer-call.html </a> into your
MyWebServer root directory.

</li><li> Use the mimer-call.html file to call your server. (Modify it if
you are using a different extension, such as .xy2.) You should now
see the associated shim.bat pop up, and display the name of the temporary
file where the data has been stored. Note that only the first steps of
those listed in mimer-call.html are going to take place, so far.

</li><li> While the "pause" is in effect you probably can look at your five lines
of data directly in the temporary file. However, when the .bat file
finishes, the browser may delete the temporary file.

</li><li> <a href="http://condor.depaul.edu/elliott/435/hw/programs/mimer/win7.html"> Here </a> is a Windows 7 tip for the shim

</li></ol> 

<h3> Step two: Write a Java program that reads environment variables, and
call it from server, through shim.bat
</h3> 

<ol>
<li> Copy the <a href="http://condor.depaul.edu/elliott/435/hw/programs/mimer/mimer-data.xyz.txt"> mimer-data.xyz </a> file to
some temporary file name if you wish, to avoid confusion. We are just going
to pass the name of this file as an argument.

</li><li> Copy <a href="http://condor.depaul.edu/elliott/435/hw/programs/mimer/Handler.java.txt"> Handler.java </a> to your development
directory, or write your own version, and compile it.

</li><li> Uncomment (that is remove the "rem" remark statement from...) the
appropriate line in shim.bat so that the
<br>  "java -Dfirstarg=%1 Handler"<br>
statement will now execute.

</li><li> In a DOS shell, call the shim.bat file, and pass mimer-data.xyz as the
first argument to it, or the name of the file into which you copied that
data as the first argument to it. Your Handler should now read, from the
java.exe environment, the name of the file that you passed to shim.bat,
which in turn passed it to java.exe through an environment variable. That
is:
<pre>
...&gt; shim mimer-data.xyz

</pre>

Handler.java should display the name of the file on the console, along
with your data.

</li><li> Start your server, and your browser, and call the server from the
mimer-call.html page. The browser should now call shim.bat which should then
call java which in turn loads Handler.class which in turn should display the
name of the temporary data file in which the browser put the five lines of
data. <p>

If all is well, you will see output from your Handler.java program displayed
on the console of the DOS CMD window invoked by your browser. Once you
clear the pause, of course, the CMD window will go away, and you will no
longer see your console output.</p><p>

You will also note that the handler writes the <i> name </i> of the
temporary data file into C:\temp\mimer.output. While the browser-invoked
version of shim.bat is paused, <i> after </i> Handler.java has run, you
should look at the contents of the temporary internet file (whose filename is
written in mimer.output), at least once.
This is the raw data output returned from your server. Once you press
enter, and release the pause in the CMD shell, this temporary file may
disappear.</p><p>

You may find that there are some issues with line-end characters, and so
forth, present in your raw server data. Additionally, for debugging
purposes, you may have to manually delete this file, to make sure that your
server is actually sending new data.</p><p>

I recommend that you also <i> clear your browser cache </i> to make sure that your
server is actually getting the request, and you will also want to make minor modifications to the data in
mimer-data.xyz from time to time to verify that the actual data is being
returned, rather than a cached copy of it. </p><p>

</p></li><li> You may have to play with this important step for a while. Do NOT
expect that everything is going to work, and that you will be able to
complete this part of the assignment without some careful thought, some
Windows hacking, some DOS .bat file hacking, some internet search for
information, and some time invested. Think
through your approach carefully. Consider what directories are being used by
which programs. Review the steps above for getting shim.bat to work. Use the
newsgroups.<p>

Once you have completed this step, then except for the Java classpath
mess, the rest is quite straightforward.</p><p>

</p></li><li> Write CAREFUL, EXTENSIVE comments for Handler.java, later to be
inserted into BCHandler.java and turned in. I gave you the
program, but expect you to show, through your comments, that you understand
how it works. That is, treat the program as some kind of essay question,
where the question is, "Exactly how does this work?" and your answer is
contained in comments.

</li></ol>

<h3>  Step Three: Write BCClient.java to serialize data to XML  </h3>
<ol> 

<li> We now leave the server environment for a while, and play with
the serializing of data into XML.

</li><li> Download <a href="http://condor.depaul.edu/elliott/435/hw/programs/mimer/xstream-1.2.1.jar"> xstream-1.2.1.jar </a> and <a href="http://condor.depaul.edu/elliott/435/hw/programs/mimer/xpp3_min-1.1.3.4.O.jar"> mimer/xpp3_min-1.1.3.4.O.jar </a> and
place them in your jdk/lib/ or jre/lib directory, or your development directory, or in
some other place where you can find them, and your classpath can find them.
You can, and should, read all about the Xstream packages at <a href="http://xstream.codehaus.org/"> http://xstream.codehaus.org/ </a>. We
borrowed these libraries gracefully offered to us so that we do not have
to write our own marshaling code for XML.

</li><li> Copy the <a href="http://condor.depaul.edu/elliott/435/hw/programs/mimer/jcxclient.bat.txt"> jcxclient.bat </a> DOS
batch file into your development directory. Modify it so that it points to
the .jar files you just downloaded in the previous step.

</li><li> Copy <a href="http://condor.depaul.edu/elliott/435/hw/programs/mimer/BCClient.java.txt"> BCClient.java </a> to your
development directory. This will soon become your Back Channel Client
that will connect back to your server at port 2570.

</li><li> Compile BCClient.java using the jcxclient.bat file. [Stands for
Java Compile Xstream Client]. You may have to play with this. In particular,
Java classpaths are often problematic. You might want to see the next step,
for running BCClient, and see if the alternate classpath method works
for the compile step. (The alternate is required for java.exe for some
reason, on my system.) Post suggestions, tips, and questions, at the
newsgroup.

</li><li> Copy the <a href="http://condor.depaul.edu/elliott/435/hw/programs/mimer/rxclient.bat.txt"> rxclient.bat </a> DOS batch file
into your development directory [stands for java run Xstream Client]. Modify
it so that it points to the .jar files you just downloaded in the previous
step. Use this batch file to load and run your BCClient.class file.

</li><li>  Once you get a compile, comment out those parts of BCClient that
require server interaction, and get it to run standalone.

</li><li> Or, you can write your own BCClient.java program from scratch that
reads in a data file, and writes XML to disk.

</li><li> Check that XML is being written to disk (in the temp directory). You
can re-route the output from the socket to the console so that you can check
the output.

</li></ol> 


<h3> Step Four: Create the BackChannel communication between your handler
and server. </h3>

<ol>

<li> Copy the <a href="http://condor.depaul.edu/elliott/435/hw/programs/mimer/BC-looper-code-snippet.txt"> BC-looper-code-snippet.txt
</a> Code SNIPPET
into your MyWebServer program, and arrange to get a compile. This snippet
is only for handling the XML stream, and you will have to refer to the
admin looper portion of your own JokeServer to invoke this worker, and
get the code working within the context of your own program.

</li><li> Re-write this very basic code so that you are comfortable with the
style, and correct working, of the java. Consider this snippet just a
set of suggestions.

</li><li> Look at <a href="http://condor.depaul.edu/elliott/435/hw/programs/mimer/BC-output.txt"> BC-output.txt </a>
file to get an idea of what the BackChannel console output should look
like on the Client and Server.

</li><li> Copy the <a href="http://condor.depaul.edu/elliott/435/hw/programs/mimer/jcx.bat.txt"> jcx.bat </a> DOS
batch file into your development directory. Modify it so that it points to
the .jar files you just downloaded in the previous step. Use this to compile
your Xstream-modified MyWebServer.java program.

</li><li> Uncomment the original BCClient code so that it again communicates with
the server through a socket. Rewrite this code so that you are comfortable
with the style.

</li><li> Start your MyWebServer so that it is now also listening for incoming
XML at the backchannel port 2570. You will need to use the <a href="http://condor.depaul.edu/elliott/435/hw/programs/mimer/rx.bat.txt"> rx.bat </a> file
so that MyWebServer knows where to find the runtime libraries for Xstream.

</li><li> Run BCClient (using rxclient.bat) and verify that it correctly
reads the data file, writes XML to local disk, sends the XML to the
server, waits synchronously for an acknowledgement that the server received
the data, and then terminates.  Check that MyWebServer receives the XML data
on its back channel, displays the XML on the server console, deserializes
the data back into symbolic form under program control, and displays
standard string reprentation of the symbolic data on the server console.

</li><li> Write CAREFUL, EXTENSIVE comments for BCClient.java later to be
inserted into BCHandler.java and turned in, and also for MyWebServer.java
(the modified portion only), treated as an essay question, as above.

</li><li> Your back channel communication is now complete. Congratulations!

</li></ol> 

<h3>  Step Five: Combine your two Java programs  </h3>

<ol> 
<li> See <a href="http://condor.depaul.edu/elliott/435/hw/programs/mimer/mimer-call.html"> mimer-call.html </a>  for an
overview.

</li><li> Combine BCClient.java and Handler.java into BCHandler.java  You are
on your own here. You have to stitch the two programs together.

</li><li> Uncomment statements from shim.bat as needed, and add your own
as needed.

</li><li> Start MyWebServer. Run BCHandler standalone from shim.bat while passing
the "local" copy of the mimer-data.xyz file as arg one. Connect to
MyWebServer, which should still print out copies of the data on the
server console.

</li><li> Note that mimer-data.xyz happens to be in both the local directory
of the Client program, and <i> also </i> in the root directory of the
server, and that both <i> just happen </i> to be the same
directory. Ordinarily, testing in this way would require two copies of
the data file, one on each machine.

</li><li> Call the server from a browser, using mimer-call.html, requesting
mimer-data.xyz. This should cause:

<ol>
<li> Return five lines of data to be returned with personal MIME header to
the Browser.
</li><li> The browser to write out the temporary data file, call shim.bat,
which calls java.exe, which loads BCHandler.class, which (a) parses the data
file name from the environment variable passed to it, (b) reads
the data file into local memory, (c) Serializes the data into XML format,
(d) Writes the XML to disk, (e) sends the XML through the back channel
of the server which is listening for it at port 2570
</li></ol>

</li><li> The server shoudl now display the XML data, and deserialized symbolic
data, on the server console.

</li><li> Insert the CAREFUL, EXTENSIVE comments you've prepared into
BCHandler.java. Add header comments at the
top of BCHandler.java explaining how the whole thing fits together.  I also
<i> strongly </i> recommend putting in basic comments about how to associate
the mime type with the file extension in Windows, since you may wish to
resurect this program in the future, and no longer have access to these
notes. Treat the program as some kind of essay question, where the question
is, "Exactly how does this work?" and your answer is contained in comments.

</li><li> Your BackChannel, XML-marshaling, personal MIME-reading, handler
programs are now complete.

</li></ol> 

Note: We are just using the MyWebServer as the BackChannel endpoint for
convenience. Of course it would be trivial to start another program
altogether, on another machine and connect to that instead. In this way we
have complete flexibility over how our back channel is implemented, what
protocol is used, which server program receives the connection, and where
that server is located.<p>

</p><h3> Step Six:  Optional bragging rights -- NOT required </h3>

<ol> 
<li> In general, you are on your own here. Have fun, and comment well.

</li><li> Please build a standard BCHandler program first, and then use
BCHandlerB.java and MyWebServerB as the file names for your extended
version.

</li><li>  Include <strong> Excplicit </strong> instructions on how
to compile and run your extended version.

</li><li> Include very careful details at the bottom of your checklist.html
file so that I know what you did.

</li><li> Advertise your work at the newsgroup, so others can benefit from
your good ideas, and get inspired.

</li><li> Consider starting with using the data file not as data, but as
run-time configuration. In this way the client actually reads the data,
and uses it in real time. For example there might not even be a
mimer-data.xyz file, it is just a dummy to signal to MyWebServer to
send back a stream telling the client where to connect for service
at that particular moment.

</li><li> Modify Client and Server to use Xstream's mapping capabilities to make
the XML more readable.

</li><li> The XML has been written to disk. This means that the data is
persistent, and it is not necessary for the backchannel server to be running
at the time the BCHandler is running. Instead you can use a persistent
communication scheme where at a <i> later time </i> the backchannel server
starts up, notifies a utility program that it is ready for the data, and
then receives it.

</li><li> Play with Xstream, which has powerful constructs built in to it.

</li><li> etc.

<h2> Associating your MIME type with a handler </h2>

[Note: I <strong> STRONGLY </strong> suggest that you do not start out using
the required .xyz file extension because you might make mistakes along the
way, and it is possible that undoing something will be much harder than just
starting over. Instead, use something like .xy1, .xy2, .xy3 and so on
until everything else is completely done, then, as a last step, install the
.xyz file extension. Once you figure out how this is done on your system,
redoing it for a new file extension takes only a minute or two.]<p>



</p></a><ul><a name="assocmime">

<li> In this example I will use the content type application/xyz, but you
will substitute your own MIME type as needed.

</li><li> This is ugly under Windows. That is just the way it is. If you use a
different client machine, or broswer, this will probably be easier, but you
will have to figure out how to do it.

</li><li> This takes place in several steps. First you have to edit your
registry, to associate the MIME type with a file extension. Then you have to
go through windows <i> explorer </i> (NOT internet explorer) to associate
the file extension with a handler.

</li><li> First, using regedit to edit your Windows registry [start | run |
regedit], add a content type for application/xyz. You do this by looking at
other examples in HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MIME\Database\Content Type, and then
copying that format by adding a new type. For example if you have MSWORD
(Microsoft Word) loaded on your machine, then you will have an entry
associating application/msword with the file extension ".doc". [Note: you
can use the EDIT menu button, or you can right-click on the "parent" entry
then "add" a new key, then on that new key "add" a new string, then right
click on the string, "Extension", to "modify" by giving it the value ".xyz"]

<pre>Edit / new / key  [application/xyz]
Edit / new / string / [Extension / .xyz]

This associates a new file extension ".xyz" with the application/xyz MIME type.

</pre>

Note: if you screw up your registry, it is possible that you will have to
re-install your operating system. But hey, you are a CS graduate student.
Editing your Windows registry is a skill you will have to develop
sometime. You can always "exit" from the registry if you are not sure what
you are doing. Adding a type should not cause problems for your system.

</li><li> Next, start windows <i> explorer </i> (NOT <i> Internet Explorer </i>)
[start | run | explorer] select Tools / Folder options / file types / New /
Create New Extension]. Add a
new file type (in my case "xyz"). Then select "change" and manually
associate your file type with your handler: change / select program from list /
browse / [find your shim.bat file]. Your path may look slightly different,
and it is possible that you are going to have to play with this for a while
to get it to work. Sorry. This is windows.<p>


Note: this step <strong> is ugly </strong> under Windows. You may very well
have to play with putting the shim.bat file in different locations, with
different names. Generally, Windows will not let you see what you have
already done, and you might have to start again. So, my recommendation is
you start out with, say shim1.bat, shim2.bat and so on. Then, after you
have everything working, use shim.bat.</p><p>



</p></li></a><li><a name="assocmime"> You will want to check the Web for tutorials like </a><a href="http://sourcedaddy.com/windows-7/defining-new-mime-type.html"> Win7
MimeTypes </a> to help with this needlessly difficult step.


</li><li> You may wish to play with the DOS commands "assoc" and "ftype". See
"help ftype" and "help assoc" to get started on this research path. Some
students have found that the assoc/ftype mechanism works.

</li><li> If you are successful, then when your browser is given a MIME type of,
in my case application/xyz, it will write the data to a temporary file, and
pass the name of the temporary file as the first argument to your handler
program --- in my case shim.bat.

</li><li> If your browser asks you what you would like to do with the program,
just tell it to open it, and it should select your handler to perform the
open. When you are ready, unselect the box that says you want the browser
to ask each time.

</li><li> For example, the console display of the argument passed to the console
application, giving the name of the temporary file might look something
like:

<pre>
arg one is: C:\Documents and Settings\elliott.CSTCIS\Local Settings
\Temporary Internet Files\Content.IE5\R38F1MYB\420[1].xyz

</pre>

</li><li> In a normal handler.exe application program, the data would be read in,
and processed directly. We have to use the DOS shim.bat file because there
are complications in passing the name of the temporary
data file through java.exe to the application program without using the
shim. That is, the first argument to java.exe is the name of the java .class
file that we want to load.

</a></p><h2><a name="mime-server"> Sending the MIME type data from your server. </a></h2><a name="mime-server">

<ul> 

<li> This is simple. You are already sending MIME types for, e.g.,
text/html, and text/plain. Now simply add some ascii data files with the
file extension of, e.g., ".xyz". When the server gets a request for a file
with the .xyz file extension, send back the MIME type "Content-Type:
application/xyz", along with the necessary carraige returns, the data, and the correct Content-length
field. That's it. You are done.

</li><li> To test your handler, you <i> might</i> wish to, first, send back some
hard-coded data from your server with the correct MIME type, the correct
length field, and some data. Then, code your server, as above, to return
arbitrary data from an .xyz file.

</li><li> Make a request for your .xyz file from your browser, and see if you handler gets called. If everything is
done correctly, your handler will get called.

</li><li> Ta-duh! you have now written a handler program, and called it from your
server. This means that your <i> server </i> is initiating program action
back on your client.
