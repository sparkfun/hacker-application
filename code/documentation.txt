The code I have included is a conversion of an old Ruby web application designed to be an event finder that complied data from multiple APIs into one central location. However, upon review of that code, I found the MVC work I had done previously to be below what I consider to be my present standards. With that in mind I converted the application to PHP, with a few changes.
For the sake of simplicity, and because I consider it to be a more representative example, the API calls have been swapped out for a simple, one-table database (defined below).
Each of the fields are of type CHAR, with the exception of time (DATETIME) and the description fields (TEXT).
The Cakephp framework code and any other similar files that the application depends on (LESS, jQuery) have not been included.
