					<h3>Stop 'n Save Donates to Breast Cancer Awareness</h3>
					
					<p>By CSD Staff</p>
					
					<p class="bold">'Pump For Prevention' campaign raises over $4,000 for research and treatment.</p>
					
					<p>Stop 'n Save has donated a total of $4,000 to four different breast cancer awareness organizations as part of their first annual &quot;Pump for Prevention&quot; campaign.</p>

					<p>The promotion, which was held on October 25, included all of the 17 Stop 'n Save locations throughout Colorado. Consumers were invited to purchase their fuel from any one of the stores on that date, and Stop ‘n Save would in turn make a donation of 5 cents for each gallon sold to Breast Cancer Awareness and Prevention programs in that area.</p>
					
					<p>The four organizations that received contributions were Walk for Life, Bosom Buddies, the Susan G. Kormen Breast Cancer Foundation and the Chaffee Country Mammography Fund.</p>
					
					<p>&quot;We are extremely pleased with the response that we received from our customers throughout Colorado. Our entire staff was dedicated to this project and the importance of being able to make a difference through our fund raising efforts,&quot; said Kent Frieling, president of Feather Petroleum Company.</p>
