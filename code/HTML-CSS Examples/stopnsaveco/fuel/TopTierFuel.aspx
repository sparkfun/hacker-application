					<h1>TOP TIER Fuel</h1>
					
					<h2 class="subheading">Is there that much difference between one brand of fuel and another?</h2>
					
					<h2>What is &quot;Top Tier&quot; and why is it important?</h2>
					
					<p>TOP TIER Detergent Gasoline is the premier standard for gasoline performance. Six of the world's top automakers, <strong>BMW, General Motors, Honda, Toyota, Volkswagen and Audi</strong> recognize that the current EPA minimum detergent requirements do not go far enough to ensure optimal engine performance.</p>

					<p>Since the minimum additive performance standards were first established by EPA in 1995, most gasoline marketers have actually reduced the concentration level of detergent additive in their gasoline by up to 50%.  As a result, the ability of a vehicle to maintain stringent Tier 2 emission standards have been hampered, leading to engine deposits which can have a big impact on in-use emissions and driver satisfaction.  These automakers have raised the bar. TOP TIER Detergent Gasoline help drivers avoid lower quality gasoline which can leave deposits on critical engine parts, which reduces engine performance.  That's something both drivers and automakers want to avoid.</p>
