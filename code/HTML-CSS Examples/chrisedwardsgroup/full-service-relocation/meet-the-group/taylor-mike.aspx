				<p>With over 8 years experience in the mortgage industry, I have learned how to simplify the mortgage process by asking the right questions. Every situation has its subtleties and a true professional can navigate through literally hundreds of programs to determine the best form of financing, and then deliver what has been promised. My area of expertise is knowing the programs and what will or will not work, so that you as the customer do not experience any &quot;last minute OOPS.&quot;</p>

				<p>For the first time buyer, that means closing on time, as expected, with no increase in required funds or interest rate. For the busy professional buying a third or fourth house, that means meeting once, and not being pestered later for more information. It also means ALWAYS being available to answer questions and expedite the process. My only goal with every transaction is to delight customers and realtors so that I might earn your referrals. The best compliment I receive when I attend closing is &quot;Wow, that was easy!&quot;</p>
				
				<p>I have lived in Raleigh for 22 years and I attended ECU. My lovely wife Joelle and my two year old, Myers, provide my motivation to work as hard as I do. I am in Raleigh and at Charter Funding for the long term, and I am always available for my customers, even years after the closing.</p>
				
				<p>I encourage you to call me for a FREE and confidential review of your home buying ability. While an initial consultation is free, it could prove to be priceless!</p>
				
				<p>Charter Funding is large enough to provide the most efficient mortgage transaction possible with all the advantages of the latest in mortgage technology; but small enough to care about each and every homeowner we serve. Their qualified staff combined with advanced technology and unparalleled service enables them to process and close your loan transaction in a prompt and efficient manner.</p>
				
				<p>&quot;Just don’t take our word for it. Here is what several satisfied clients have said about Mike Taylor:

				Adam and Jennifer H.</p>
				
				<p>&quot;It was an absolute pleasure doing business with your company. You have a staff of thoroughly dedicated professionals that I would highly recommend in the future. On a scale of 1-10 you all would, without a doubt, receive an “11” from me.&quot;<br />
				Arlen and Debra M.</p>
				
				<p>&quot;Charter Funding was very helpful, dependable, looked out for my needs and always kept me posted on what was going on with my loan. I am very happy to have worked with a wonderful group of people. Could not have asked for anyone better. Thanks for all you did!!&quot;<br />
