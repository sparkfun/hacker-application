				<h1 class="body">Durham, North Carolina Profile</h1>
								
				<p>Durham County enjoys a population of over 239,000 and an economic base that is diverse and growing. The County is located at the apex of the vast Research Triangle Region, centered among the cities of Durham, Chapel Hill, and the state capital, Raleigh. These three anchors encompass the world-renowned Research Triangle Park (RTP). RTP, located primarily in southern Durham County, is the world's largest and most successful university-related research and development business park.</p>
				
				<p><strong>Research Triangle Park</strong></p>
				
				<p>In the 1950s-60s, what is now the world's largest university-related research park and namesake for the vast Triangle region was carved from Durham pinelands as a special Durham County tax district. Research Triangle Park is encompassed on three sides by the City of Durham, with a small portion now spilling into Wake County toward Cary and Morrisville. RTP scientists have developed everything from Astroturf® to AZT and won Nobel Prizes in the process. Now, nearly 140 major research and development companies, including <a href="http://www.bayer.com/" target="_blank">Bayer</a>, <a href="http://www.gsk.com/" target="_blank">GlaxoSmithKline</a>, <a href="http://www.ibm.com/us/" target="_blank">IBM</a>, <a href="http://www.ul.com/" target="_blank">Underwriters Laboratories</a>, and agencies such as the EPA, employ more than 45,000.</p>
				
				<p><strong>A Fortunate Marketing Mistake</strong></p>
				
				<p>The origin of Durham's nickname, the "Bull City," has nothing to do with cattle!</p>
				
				<p>John Green of the Blackwell Tobacco Company named his product "Bull" Durham Tobacco after Colman's Mustard, which used a bull in its logo and which Green mistakenly thought was produced in Durham, England.</p>
				
				<p>By the time James B. Duke of the American Tobacco Company purchased the Blackwell Tobacco Company in 1898, Bull Durham was the most famous trademark in the world. It sparked such popular phrases as "bullpen" (from a Bull Durham ad painted behind the Yankees' dugout) and "shooting the bull" (most likely from chewing tobacco). The famous bull's image was painted all over the world, including on the Great Pyramid of Egypt!</p>
				
				<p>Duke put cigarette cards, predecessors of modern baseball cards, into each pack of tobacco. By the 1930's they were immensely popular, and today they are much sought-after collectors' items.</p>
				
				<p>The City of Durham, the only municipality within Durham County, is known as the "City of Medicine" because of the cluster of healthcare, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies that thrive in the Greater Durham area. Duke University, consistenly ranked among the nation's top-10 universities, as well as North Carolina Central University, are both located in the City of Durham. <a href="http://medschool.duke.edu/" target="_blank">Duke University Medical Center</a> is recognized as one of America's top health care providers.</p>
				
				<p>Durham ranks fourth on the list of largest cities in the state, yet still maintains the friendly character of a small town. Both residents and visitors alike enjoy the host of cultural, historical, educational, and natural amenities that Durham has to offer.</p>

				<p>During the day, you may want to take your kids to visit the acclaimed, entirely hands-on Museum of Life and Science or visit some of Durham's many historic sites, like Bennett Place or Stagville. Perhaps you want to explore the miles of nature trails along the Eno River, or take a lighter stroll through the beautiful <a href="http://www.hr.duke.edu/dukegardens/dukegardens.html" target="_blank">Sarah P. Duke Gardens</a>. If you like sports, you'll be happy to know that Durham and the Triangle have them all. When it comes to college basketball though, we must warn you, we are fanatics!</p>
				
				<p>At night, you may want to enjoy a live performance at Duke University or the beautifully restored <a href="http://www.carolinatheatre.org/" target="_blank">Carolina Theatre</a> in Downtown Durham. We also have some of the Triangle's, and indeed the South's, best restaurants. Put on your bib for some finger-licking barbecue, or straighten your tie for a great piece of steak or fish. Our restaurants will not disappoint you!</p>
