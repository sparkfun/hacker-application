				<h1>Multiple Offers to Sell Your House</h1>
									
				<p>Chris Edwards will quickly show you every offer you receive on your house as soon as he receives them. You are not bound by a "first come, first served" rule. That is, you can accept any offer, regardless of when you received it. You may choose to negotiate with any prospective buyer as long as the choice is not made for a reason that would violate Fair Housing laws.</p>
				
				<p>Chris will notify the Buyers' Agents if you have received more than one offer, but will not disclose the terms of the competing offers. This would be called "shopping" offers to purchase. The law requires that real estate agents treat prospective buyers honestly and fairly. </p>
				
				<p>Once you've received all the offers, Chris will discuss the issues, help you determine which is best, and whether you should accept it.</p>
					
				<p>If none of the offers are acceptable, you can reject all of them. Chris would then suggest the Buyers' Agents make new or better offers. Chris might, at that point, verbally suggest the minimum price and terms you would consider.  You could also instuct Chris to make a counter offer to one of the prospective buyers with terms you would accept.</p>
