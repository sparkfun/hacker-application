						<tr><td class="question">Q: I'm selling my house. I'd rather not pay a high commission.</td></tr>
						<tr><td class="answer">A: Lower commissions are attractive but could cost you more in the long run. Agents who offer lower commissions usually cannot offer the wealth of resources you'll get from the Chris Edwards Group. Resources like an aggressive marketing program & agent networking!</td></tr>
						<tr><td class="answer">Resources that can get you a better offer in a more timely fashion! Long market time can be a big detriment to selling your home.  So before going with the lowest commission Agent, compare services. Usually, you get what you pay for.</td></tr>
						<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
						
						<tr><td class="question">Q: I've only lived here for two years. Can I sell after such a short time?</td></tr>
						<tr><td class="answer">A: You can sell whenever you want unless there's a prepayment penalty on your mortgage. Or your loan is from SONYMA (where some restrictions apply).</td></tr>
						<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
						
						<tr><td class="question">"I'm not sure I want to sell right now unless I can get what I need."</td></tr>
						<tr><td class="answer">Unfortunately the housing market has a mind of it's own. Buyers and agents do their homework on what a home's true market value is and how long a home has been on the market.  We always explain to our clients to put themselves in the educated buyer's shoes and ask, "would I buy my home back for this price?"</td></tr>
						<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
						
						<tr><td class="question">"I'll just put my home out there at a high price and see what happens."</td></tr>
						<tr><td class="answer">This can be a very damaging thing to do that can bring much frustration!  If your home doesn't sell or get showings, you've just bought permanent market time and some negative publicity.  It is always best to put your home on the market when you are truly ready to sell.</td></tr>
