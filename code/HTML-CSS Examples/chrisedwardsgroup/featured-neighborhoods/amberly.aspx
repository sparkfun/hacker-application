						<p>Welcome to one of Cary's hottest new communities! Amberly! Once complete, this planned community will offer natural areas, retail space, shopping areas, 276 acres of common areas, miles of greenway trail and many exclusive amenities!</p>

Within the residents club you'll find a fitness center, aerobics room, children's play room, teen room, decks and patios and flexible meeting areas. With an abundance of amenities and an incredible location, Amberly is a must see community!</p>

Travel 5.6 miles, turn right on McCrimmon Parkway.  Proceed 1.3 miles to Amberly.&quot;</p>
