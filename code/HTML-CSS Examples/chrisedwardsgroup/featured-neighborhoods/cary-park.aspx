						<p>The concept is a relatively simple one. Create a neighborhood where people live and learn. Shop and dine. Work and play. And get virtually all of their needs met. Without ever having to hop in the car. And without ever having to leave home. Then, put this unique, state-of-the-art, exceptionally pedestrian-friendly village a few short miles from the Research Triangle Park. Cary Park features a 28-acre lake, biking and walking trails, swim club, village center and even a new elementary school.</p> 

						<p>Cary Park was designed around people, not the automobile. Sidewalks typically line both sides of every street, creating a safe environment for walking around the neighborhood. Cary Park also features tree-lined streets, creating a canopy between the sidewalk and the street.</p>
						
						<p>Cary Park is more like a village! It's complete with a village center, shops, retail stores, offices, condos and places to eat, and yes, people you see every day and actually get to know. Sounds like quite a place doesn't it? A world of your own. A house that's not a carbon copy of the one down the street.</p>
						
						<p>The proposed Town Center will be a major focal point and vibrant part of Cary Park. This 30-acre site will feature an attractive and inviting mix of shops, restaurants, offices and condos. The Cary Park Town Center will be designed to be reminiscent of a small downtown featuring canopied shops, sidewalks, courtyards and tree-lined streets. The Cary Park Town Center will be pedestrian friendly, making it easy and convenient to pick up dry cleaning, grab lunch with a friend, and then head back to the office.</p> 
						<p>The Town Center will be at the intersection of Carpenter Fire Station and Green Level to Durham roads and within walking and biking distance of all homes at Cary Park.</p>
						
						<p>Located south of the lake, the Cary Park Club features a 6-lane competition lap pool, 98-foot waterslide, zero-entry fun pool, volleyball court and play field. The clubhouse features a snack bar, big screen televisions, meeting room and activities area. Both children and adult activities are available year-round. A sampling includes water aerobics, swim team, holiday socials, movie night, Monday night football parties, ice cream socials, and much more! Membership to the Club is optional for residents of Cary Park. (see diagram below)</p>

						<p>Cary Park Lake measures 28 acres and is stocked with fish. Two miles of paved trails surround the lake, perfect for walking, running, rollerblading, cycling and strolling the kids. The trail on the north side of the lake is part of the Town of Cary's Greenway system. The Town has an extensive Greenway plan developed which shows Cary Park's Greenway Trail eventually connecting with both Brooks Park and Fred Bond Park.</p>
						
						<p>But with its architectural diversity and proximity to the Research Triangle Park, Cary Park is not only accessible. Its a few hundred acres of perfection in an otherwise crazy world. With beautiful homes. Great builders. Sidewalks. Tree-lined streets. Greenway trails. 28-acre lake. Swim club. Shopping. Dining. And more. Even a new school. A list of amenities as long as your arm!</p> 
						
						<p>Cary Park is located in west Cary, 1 1/2 miles west of Highway 55 on Carpenter Fire Station Road. The neighborhood is only 5 miles from the Research Triangle Park, the area's central workplace. Cary Park is also close to area schools, shopping, dining and recreation, including Town of Cary parks and Jordan Lake.</p>
