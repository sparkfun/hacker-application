				<h1>Buyers Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
									
					<table border="0" class="faq">
						<tbody>
							
							<tr><td class="question">Q: How can I get prequalified?</td></tr>
							<tr><td class="answer">A: Just click here to see our list of <a href="/mortgage-information/preferred-lenders.aspx">preferred lenders</a>.</td></tr>
							<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
							
							<tr><td class="question">Q: Should I get pre-qualified now even if it will take a while to find a house?</td></tr>
							<tr><td class="answer">A: If you plan to move within six months, you should get pre-qualifed before you start house-hunting. Being approved for a mortgage gives you an edge as a buyer.  You will need to be pre-qualified before making an offer. It also confirms what price range you should be looking in based on your income & expenses.  Mainly, it's the crucial first step to start the home-buying process!</td></tr>
							<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>

							<tr><td class="question">Q: I don't know if I'm ready to handle a mortgage. Why not just rent?</td></tr>
							<tr><td class="answer">A: Buying a home may actually be more affordable than renting. Plus you get a tax advantage: you can write off the interest on your mortgage. There are so many financing programs available now which has made it that much easier to get into a home! </td></tr>
							<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
							
							<tr><td class="question">Q: My credit record isn't perfect. Will this get in the way of my getting a mortgage?</td></tr>
							<tr><td class="answer">A: Not always. Especially if your 'imperfections' were a while ago and you've been on time with your recent payments. Mortgage bankers consider many things, such as your recent (timely) payments, current income, and down payment. Fill out a pre-qualification application today and a financial specialist with call you to discuss your situation. </td></tr>
							<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
							
							<tr><td class="question">Q: Can I buy a home if I don't have a down payment?</td></tr>
							<tr><td class="answer">A: Definitely. Many lenders offer financing options without a down payment.</td></tr>
							<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
							
							<tr><td class="question">Q: I've gone through bankruptcy. Can I own a home?</td></tr>
							<tr><td class="answer">A: Most likely. If you've been current with your bills for a while after discharge of bankruptcy, there's a good chance.</td></tr>
							<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
							
							<tr><td class="question">Q: Do I need an agent to buy a house? Can't I just call the listing agent myself?</td></tr>
							<tr><td class="answer">A: The listing agent represents the seller. He or she gets a commission for selling the house. Having your own agent means you have someone looking out for your best interests ... not the seller's.</td></tr>
							<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
							
							<tr><td class="question">Q: Can you explain the typical real estate transaction process?</td></tr>
