				<h1>What happens when there are multiple offers to buy a house?</h1>
									
				<p>Your offer will quickly be presented to the seller. If the seller receives more than one offer, there is no "first come, first served" rule. The seller may accept any offer. And the seller may negotiate with any buyer (as long as the choice doesn't violate Fair Housing laws).</p>
				
				<p>The seller's agent will, in most cases, let us know that other offers were made. The seller's agent will not disclose the amount of each competing offer. This is called "shopping" offers to purchase. The law requires that real estate agents treat prospective buyers honestly and fairly. As part of this law, agents may not disclose terms of competing offers.</p>
				
				<p>Chris will never try and pressure you into buying a house just because there are offers from other individuals on the table. If you make an offer for a house and the seller accepts another offer, Chris will try to find out why your offer was not accepted to assist you as you continue to search for a home.</p>
				
				<p>Chris will make every effort to get you the home you want and will look for solutions to get your offer accepted!</p>
