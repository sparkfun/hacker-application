# Open Source Projects

* I wrote
	[useless/legacycookie](https://github.com/pteague/useless-legacycookie)
	as a complete overhaul to what we were originally using at Essential
	Elements. Lots of legacy code using cookies for things they should have
	been using sessions for instead.
* I wrote [useless/pdo-wrapper](https://github.com/pteague/useless-pdo-wrapper)
	with the idea of trying to fix some of the long running processes at
	Essential Elements that were getting the "MySQL server has gone away"
	error because Multi-Master Replication Manager for MySQL had cut the
	connection. Unfortunately I had to stop working on it to help bring our
	client's new developers up to speed with various project's code and never
	got back to this.
* I submitted several push requests to
	[BigE/SiTech release 1.2](https://github.com/BigE/SiTech/tree/release-1.2)
	for needed bug fixes while at Essential Elements.
* I have a back and forth relationship with
	[phpLDAPadmin](https://github.com/leenooks/phpLDAPadmin). I've had a few
	small patches/pull requests accepted over the years. A very big problem is
	a large reliance upon PHP output buffering for cleaning up all sorts of
	errors.
* I used to submit patches to [phpEclipse](http://www.phpeclipse.com/) for
	templates to keep them up to date with PHP version changes.
