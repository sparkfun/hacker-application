Open Source Contributions

p5.js - I have recently become a contributor to the open source library, p5.js. I was invited to attend a contributor's conference in late May 2015. At this conference, I was part of the bugs/devops team, and we worked mostly to improve the functionality of the core library. I also supplied sample artwork done in p5.js to be featured on the home page for June 2015, as well as in the example library.
