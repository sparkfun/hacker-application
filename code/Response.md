-- I don't have development code that I can share, as it is company property. I have experience coding at server site. Language I have used is JAVA. I have written some code in C# during early phase of may carrier. I will be happy to discuss, as needed.
-- I have captured technical requirements with client. I can not share those samples. At times, I do discuss complex business requirement as well, in order to be able to design the solution in scalable and standard product approach manner. I write user stories, in JIRA. I feel I do ask right questions to client, in order to map Business requirement to a software/technical solution.
