I've tried my best to convey samples of my coding experience.  The files are mostly .aspx format for web pages, .cs files for C# files and .txt or .sql files for examples of T-SQL.  Hopefully these will be easy enough to view in a text editor such as Notepad++ or Sublime with ease if you don't have a version of Visual Studio installed.  If you do have Visual Studio, the project/solution files are included and should be easy to import.

- I have included examples of the work I've done in ASP.NET.  I apologize this is not the preferred medium and I understand you are looking primarily for PHP developers.

- I've tried my best to include examples of code that is hand-written, is standard, includes the stylesheets as well as well as consistent formatting, which is something I strive for with everything I develop.

I've broken my code down into the following **folders** to view examples of my work:

**HTML-CSS Examples**: Includes 2 full websites.  One a fairly large Real Estate website (chrisedwardsgroup).  One a website for convenience store chain based in Western Colorado (stopnsaveco).

**C# and ASP.NET**: Includes all the source code and project/solution files for Visual Studio.  Examples are an IDX update system which grabs a plain text file feed and converts it to a database (IDXUpdate).  A conversion program and a custom upgrader to convert one IDX system to another type (AccessDataUpgrader, CRENConversion, DatabaseConverter).  A highly modified shopping cart system (ASPDotNetStoreFront). And the files that go with the 2 customer sites listed above (ChrisEdwardsGroup, ChrisEdwardsGroupAdmin, and StopNSave).

**SQL**:  This is where I've given examples of the T-SQL code I've written for each application as well as some code plucked from various stored procedures.  90% of my applications were written to use stored procedures rather than raw SQL for the performance benefit.  I tried to pick out just useful and indicative samples to see structure and ability.  I have a boatload of stored procedures I'd be more than happy to show as well as database diagrams.  I really love to design databases.  Architecting correctly from the start is **key (:-D)** and I'd love to discuss in further detail.
