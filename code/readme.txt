The samples I've provided:

- products.class.php: I use for most of my projects that I modify per use. This particular class is used for an e-commerce store that I am in the process of rebuilding (hauteheadquarters.com). It's a simple site, and the original didn't have classes or any sort of OOP. I wrote the initial site in 2009 and have since learned better techniques and how to code better.

- song_generator.php: I don't write a lot of algorithms, so when you asked, I figured I'd go ahead and make one. I know you said you didn't want to "run" the code, but I think you should - it's a lot of fun. And if you have someone there who has a guitar, get that out and start playing!

- global.css: I love CSS and I figured I'd throw one of those in here, too.


My experience has really been lonely as a developer, I haven't worked in a larger group than 3, but I'd love to have the opportunity to do so. I think it's an amazing thing when people come together, their brains can function all together.
