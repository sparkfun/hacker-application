We want to see your code. Please include a representative sample of your
work in this directory.

All languages and paradigms are welcome, but we're most interested in
submissions demonstrating one or more of the following:

  - Clean, secure, object oriented PHP.
  - Usable, modern, and reasonably standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
  - Clear, sensible, and consistently formatted code.
  - Sympathy for the plight of future maintainers.

If you maintain or contribute to any open source projects, please supply links
and a short description of your role in each project.

**Tips:**

 * Avoid excessive amounts of code.
 * Exclude third party utilities and other dependencies like XML libraries or binaries.
 * Your samples will be *read*, not *executed*.
 * Less is more.
 * Select samples that are brief and show off different characteristics of your skill set.

In lieu of or in addition to code samples please also consider providing writing samples.
When applying for a more managerial position this is of particular importance as
clear written communication is critical.

#### Objective
I used my Galvanize capstone project, WillCallTickets, written in Angular 1, to demonstrate 
what represents my current coding style. This project represents a simple shopping cart 
application that allows members to sell show tickets and merchandise (products) without 
service fees. It uses Stripe for member on-boarding/vetting and for user checkout. 

The entire repo exists at (https://github.com/WillCallTickets/WillCall) and I am happy 
to provide any other code samples or explanations. A live example can be found 
at (https://willcalltickets.herokuapp.com/).
   
For this code submission, I have flattened out the directory structure for easier perusal.

I am a strong believer in making code readable and understandable to the next developer that 
needs to maintain the code. I have experienced this firsthand many times in others code and 
admittedly my own. 

I am also aware that my styling and comment style leaves room for improvement, and continues to 
evolve over time. 

Also included are a few sql examples that I had used in my e-commerce solution for sts9store.com.

I do not have any PHP examples to show - generally, my PHP experience was based upon wordpress 
sites where I was tasked with maintaining and adding small features. I have created 
custom sites based upon restaurant themes using custom post types for VicsEspresso and 
TheHungryToad.com. At any rate, I feel confident in being able to pickup PHP coding in a short 
amount of time.

I have also included a few samples from my Sts9Store application in the C-Sharp folder.
