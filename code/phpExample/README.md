# Weather App

## Why I choose the Weather Application for code example

>I choose to do a weather application for my code example because of my ongoing interest in tracking weather and because I recently started development on a personal project with the same title with a Node, PostgreSQL, React and Redux stack.  This got me thinking, how would it look to implement a simple version of this in PHP? The contents of this directory is that thought in action. Here you will find a simple PHP weather app making requests to two separate API’s (Google’s Geocode and Forecast.io) to display the current weather conditions of the given location. 

>This was a fun challenge to do because as a developer I have worked on projects that have ranged from static informative websites using JQuery, vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS (vanilla CSS, Stylus, and LESS). I have also contributed to NodeJS applications using MithrilJS combined with Redux for the front end and PostgreSQL and MongoDB for the backend. So as I gain experience I have realized that there isn’t one way to create an web application and each project takes careful consideration of the requirements to pick the right tool for the job.
