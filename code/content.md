**Description**
Datalanche is a partly open source project which aims at making database 
management simple. This library is an OO API client which takes nested 
arrays of information and makes it simple to form queries. 
All post query content is formulated in json format.
(**Notice**: This is a project created and owned by Datalnche Inc. 
My contributions extend so far as my commit history to repo.
For this particular project I helped redevelop large parts of
the PHP API to deal with new syntactical conventions and the
addition of new features to the application.)
