# Strat-o-matic basic game player value calculator
# The simple calculator lets you evaluate how well a hitter will do against a pitcher
# trying to emulate  a sabermetic concept of RC27
# which reviews how many runs a team of the same player would score in a game

# we need a random number generator to get dice rolls 
import random

# What follows is the data structure for a hitter
# 11 item list that would include actions that result from 2D6 die roll, 2-12
# each action is either an strike out (so), which increments the out counter
# or is a homerun (HR) and will add a run
# For simplicity, I loaded a sample hitter
H1 = ['HR','so','so','so','so','so','so','so','so','so','HR','HR']

# it follows the same format as a hitter
# again for simplicity, a sample pitcher

# on the board game, a 1,2 or 3 on the selector dice would be judged based on the hitters chart
# and a 4,5, or 6 would be based on the pitchers dice

# This getABResult takes the combined action chart for the hitter and batter
# It also takes the row value, which is the selected row that the result is derived from
# it will also take the column which is the location of the result in the row 
# This adjusts for Zero's based in index arrays and will give the AB result
