We want to see your code. Please include a representative sample of your
work in this directory.

All languages and paradigms are welcome, but we're most interested in
submissions demonstrating one or more of the following:

  - Clean, secure, object oriented PHP.
  - Usable, modern, and reasonably standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

**Tips:**

 * Avoid excessive amounts of code.
 * Exclude third party utilities and other dependencies like XML libraries or binaries.

In lieu of or in addition to code samples please also consider providing writing samples.
When applying for a more managerial position this is of particular importance as
clear written communication is critical.

**About the Code**
This code was written for a large pharmaceutical company called AbbVie.  You may not have heard of them, but you may have seen commercials for one of their most successful products called Humira.  

This small Facebook app was written to increase awareness of a separate AbbVie Public Relations campaign called PsoriasisSpeaks and it revolves around a gender-neutral character called Double Whammy (DW).  You can watch a short commercial featuring DW at https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=752955758071122&set=vb.367781396588562&type=3&theater

The code allows the user to personalize DW with accessories like hats, sunglasses and shoes, as well as show symptoms of their own pain such as lightning bolts near the feet and bricks near the head. 

As part of the business logic, no symptom may cover DW and accessories may only be placed in certain spots.

The web app was designed as a Facebook page and appeared on AbbVie's Facebook during the PsoriasisSpeaks campaign.
