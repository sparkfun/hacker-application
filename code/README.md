audition* for some good Mysql/PHP
yayabe-pics for JS/CSS

Don't feel obliged to read it all if it's too much.
Just wanted to provide a complete-ish picture of what I know.

-----------------------------------------

We want to see your code. Please include a representative sample of your
work in this directory.

All languages and paradigms are welcome, but we're most interested in
submissions demonstrating one or more of the following:

  - Clean, secure, object oriented PHP.
  - Usable, modern, and reasonably standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
  - Clear, sensible, and consistently formatted code.
  - Sympathy for the plight of future maintainers.

If you maintain or contribute to any open source projects, please supply links
and a short description of your role in each project.

**Tips:**

 * Avoid excessive amounts of code.
 * Exclude third party utilities and other dependencies like XML libraries or binaries.
 * Your samples will be *read*, not *executed*.
 * Less is more.
 * Select samples that are brief and show off different characteristics of your skill set.
