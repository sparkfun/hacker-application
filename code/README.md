I have included two pages and the artist class from the lib.php file that they both reference. If you go to http://exigentrecords.com/artists.php you'll see the live page, artists.php, as it fetches MySQL db info to populate the page with artist information. Once a user is logged in as an admin, they can add, edit, or delete artists. I have included the edit_artist.php page as well.

Ideal candidates will be comfortable building web applications with PHP and
MySQL on Linux, and have real-world experience with other languages and
platforms.

We want to see your code. Please include a representative sample of your
work in this directory.

All languages and paradigms are welcome, but we're most interested in
submissions demonstrating one or more of the following:

  - Clean, secure, object oriented PHP.
  - Usable, modern, and reasonably standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
  - Clear, sensible, and consistently formatted code.
  - Sympathy for the plight of future maintainers.

If you maintain or contribute to any open source projects, please supply links
and a short description of your role in each project.

**Things to avoid:**

  - Excessive amounts of code. Your samples will be *read*, not *executed*. More
    than 1000 lines of code and you're doing it wrong.
  - Irrelevant dependencies. The large XML library that your class relies upon
    is neither interesting nor helpful.
  - Binaries. Just don't.
  - Third party libraries. If you didn't write it, don't include it. If you only
    edited the configuration file for it, don't include it.

Select samples that are brief and show off different characteristics of your skill set.
A brief, well-written class, a neat little algorithm, stuff like that. Less is more.
