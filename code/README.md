Internship:

My name is Andy Nguyen, I am a Data Analyst looking to become a Web Developer. Unfortunately, I am unable to produce my own code so I have written an
explanation of current coding adventures. It was not until the last year did I realize how much I enjoyed coding, but also the community of coders. I am reaching out
to Sparkfun specifically because the company seems to hit home in three areas:  growth, culture, and fun. Currently, I am in the sixth week of a Ruby on Rails 11
week program and we have covered Ruby, Github, Pivotal Tracker, and Rspec. This week we will be implementing our first Ruby Rails framework. We will be
covering the MVC model and some handy generators you can use for testing on Rails. To find more details about our course itinerary please follow;
http://davincicoders.com/building-the-toolbelt-of-a-junior-ruby-on-rails-developer/. Although I am a novice, I enjoy the challenges of programming and I hope to
further my career at Sparkfun as an intern. Thank you for reading this letter, please contact me at (720) 935-9330 or nhi.atn@gmail.com .
