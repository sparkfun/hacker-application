# PHP and JS Code from Jasand Pereza

In this directory, you will find examples of PHP and JavaScript code. The PHP code **SiteWideSearch** features search functionality I wrote and used on various projects at my current job. The JavaScript portion contains a few files from a React.js component **AddMany** that has also been used but for pretty much all projects (websites) at my current job. In each folder, you will find a README.md file describing what each of the code does.

#### My GitHub account
You're more than welcome to checkout (no phun intended) my GitHub account at https://github.com/jasand-pereza. There you will find the complete project of the AddMany featured in this repository and look at anything else that catches your eye.
