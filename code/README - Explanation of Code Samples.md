Thank you for looking through my code!

I have included a couple of things to show my skill sets.

1) html samples/index.html
	Technologies Used:  Bootstrap, AngularJS, html

	This is showing the homepage for my epeharda.com website.  I included it to show all of the dependancies that I used on the site as well as how I incorporated bootstrap styling.

2) html samples/contact.html
	Technologies Used:  AngularJS, Bootstrap, JavaScript (calling this upon validation)

	I wanted to include the html file that calls some back end javascript samples I have provided for email
	validation.  Please see the "controller.js" file to view what happens when a user submits a valid contact
	form!  You can find the specific code in the "EmailController"

3)  JS samples/controller.js
	Technoligies Used:  JavaScript, AngularJS, API from mandrill (mandrill.com)

	This javascript sample shows my use of an API for email submission.  I'm using the http 'post' protocol to submit the contact
	information through madrill's api.  I love their API because they provide a lot of useful statistics when needed, and it worked
	perfectly for this small(ish) project of mine.

4)  JS samples/puzzle.js
	Technoligies Used: JavaScript

	I found this problem in the "Cracking the Coding Interview" book a while ago.  I love puzzles and brain teasers.  I included
	the runtime complexity as well at the bottom of the code sample.

LASTLY

Please see my current project (from work) at https://github.com/iLegislate
*I have encouraged my team to use github for this new project, and we have loved it thus far.  There are three contributors to the project (including myself).  We are using appcelerator so taht we use one code base (javascript) to deploy on multiple devices (in our case- Android, Apple, and the web).

Thanks again!  
Live long and prosper.
