    <h1>jscalendar release notes</h1>

    <p>This release compiled at Friday,  9 Jan 2004 (12:27).</p>

    <h2>0.9.5</h2>

    <p>
      This release's primary goal is to fix a wrong license statement which
      can be found in some files from 0.9.4.  For instance in README or
      calendar.js, the statement was that the code is distributed under the
      GNU GPL; that's because I had plans to change the license, then
      changed my mind but unfortunately I committed files so.  I am sorry
      for this inconvenience, please use the latest (0.9.5) release which is
      fully covered by LGPL.
    </p>

    <p>Other changes:</p>

    <ul>

      <li>
        <b>Fixed</b> an annoying bug that prevented the calendar to display
	correctly when it was configured for an input field inside a
	<b>scrolling area</b>.  <b>Many thanks</b> to Ian Barrack (<a
	href="http://www.simban.com">Simban.com</a>) who pointed it up and
	donated quite some money for the Calendar project!
      </li>

      <li>
        All examples use UTF-8 now; the translations may not be all
        up-to-date, but I <strong>strongly</strong> suggest everyone to use
        UTF-8; other encodings are a plain mess.  So far I know for sure
        that Romanian translation will work with UTF-8 and <em>not
        anymore</em> with ISO-8859-2.  Other translations are probably
        usable under UTF-8, but if your preferred language isn't... ;-)
        please make it and send it to me for inclusion.
      </li>

      <li>
        Fixed small bug in the documentation (one footnote didn't appear
        where it should have).
      </li>

      <li>
        Updated translations: DE, ES, HU, IT, RO.  Thanks to everyone who
        sent translations!
      </li>

    </ul>

    <h2>0.9.4</h2>

    <h3>New stuff</h3>

    <ul>

      <li>Supports time selection.  Yes. ;-) This work has been largely
        sponsored by <strong>Himanshukumar Shah</strong> (thank you!).  See
        the docs and example files for details on how to setup.</li>

      <li>Easy to link 2 or more fields by using the new
        <code>onUpdate</code> parameter of <code>Calendar.setup</code>.  This
        is useful, say, to automatically set a value in a second field based
        on the value selected in the first field.  See the documentation and
        first sample in <a href="simple-1.html">simple-1.html</a>.</li>

      <li>Other <code>Calendar.setup</code> low-level parameters, for those
        wanting to have the complete control: <code>onSelect</code> and
        <code>onClose</code>.  The handlers are called when something is
        selected in the calendar or when the calendar is closed.</li>

      <li>The translation files can optionally include the short day names
        and the short month names.  That's because in some languages, like
        German, the short form is not the first 3 letters of the entire name
        but only the first 2.  Also in other languages short names can't be
        as easily derived from the full name by just calling substr, so this
        patch solves the problem.</li>

      <li>Implemented a nice way to make some dates "special" (look
        different).  Specifically, the <code>setDisabledHandler</code> method
        was replaced with the more general <code>setDateStatusHandler</code>
        method (the old one is still available for backwards compatibility but
        <em>will</em> be removed).  More details about this in the
        documentation.  Also see <a href="simple-3.html">simple-3.html</a>
        for a live sample.</li>

      <li>Date parsing and formatting engine is now rewritten and supports a
        subset of <code>strftime</code> format specifiers from ANSI C.  This
        makes it possible to use dates like "YYYYMMDD" (the corresponding
        format for this would be "%Y%m%d").  Details in the documentation.
        <b>Please note that the new engine is not compatibile with older
          calendar releases!</b></li>

      <li>Along with the new date parser I workarounded an unpleasant crash
        that occurred in IE when certain accented characters appeared in the
        texts.  I think German was one of the language with such problems, and
        the workaround was to use the letter without an accent.  Well, now you
        can translate to whatever you want.</li>

      <li>"Fixes" (I mean, "horrible workarounds") for Konqueror (and
        hopefully Safari).  Unfortunately, this otherwise excellent browser
        still has some bugs that keep the calendar from working
        <em>exactly</em> as it should..  But they're going to be fixed,
        right? ;-)</li>

      <li>CSS themes got pretty much modified too so if you wrote your theme
        you need to update it.  Aside for the time selector support, the CSS
        themes contain a simple hack that makes the navigation buttons show
        a little arrow in the lower-right corner which indicates that if one
        holds the mouse a menu will appear.</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Translation files</h3>

    <p>The translation files need to be updated in order for the calendar to
      work properly.  Currently the only updated files are calendar-en.js
      (main file) and calendar-ro.js (well, yes, I am a Romanian ;-).</p>

    <p>Specifically, they need the following:</p>

    <ul>

      <li>Correct date format, according with the new format specifiers
        introduced in 0.9.4.  Details about the available format specifiers
        in the documentation</li>

      <li>Short day or month names, <em>if required</em>.  If they can be
        derived by taking the first N letters of the full name then a simple
        Calendar._SDN_len = N or Calendar._SMN_len = N will suffice.  If N
        is 3 then nothing needs to be done as we take it for granted if no
        other option is offered ;-)</li>

      <li>We have some new texts that shows short usage information as well
        as copyright information.</li>

    </ul>

    <p>If your favorite language is not there yet, or it is but not updated
      according to the main calendar-en.js file, then please consider
      translating calendar-en.js and send the translation back to me so that
      I include it in the official distribution.</p>

    <h3>Bug status</h3>

    <p>Check <a
        href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=544285&group_id=75569&func=browse">SourceForge</a>,
      I didn't keep track.  However, there were a lot of bugfixes.</p>

    <h2>0.9.3</h2>    

    <h3>New stuff</h3>

    <ul>

      <li>Opera&nbsp;7 compatibility &mdash; keyboard navigation is
        still not available; text selection can't be disabled, leading to an
        ugly effect when walking through the month/year menus.</li>

      <li>Ability to align the calendar relative to the input field (or any
        other element).  Vertical: top, center, bottom.  Horizontal: left,
        center, right.  This is established as a new parameter for
        <tt>showAtElement</tt>.</li>

      <li>Added <tt>dateClicked</tt> property (boolean).  This can be
        inspected in the "onSelect" handler to determine if a date was
        really clicked or the user only changed month/year using the menus.
        You <em>need</em> to check this for "single-click" calendars and
        only close/hide the calendar if it's <tt>true</tt>.</li>

      <li>Full documentation in <a href="doc/html/reference.html">HTML</a>
        and <a href="doc/reference.pdf">PDF</a> format is now available in the
        distribution archive.</li>

      <li>New language definition files: HU, HR, PT, ZH.  Thanks those who
        submitted!</li>

    </ul>

            title="Go to bug description at sourceforge"><tt>#721,833</tt></a> &mdash; won't fix (we won't set the time to
        midnight; time might actually be useful when we implement support
        for time selection).
