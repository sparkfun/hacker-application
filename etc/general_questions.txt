What is your desired compensation range? (Range meaning the least you're comfortable with to the most you think you're worth.)

- I'm looking for an above-average range for a recent graduate for the area, so about $60,000-$65,000.

When can you start?

- I need about 1.5-2 weeks for relocation. I can start any time after that.

Do you have any planned vacations/absences in the next six months that we should know about?

No planned vacations or absences here.

SparkFun is a dog-friendly environment. Are comfortable working around dogs? If you are a dog-owner, would you see yourself bringing dogs to work?

- I'm not a dog owner, but am comfortable working around dogs.

The active developer keeps up on happenings in the world of development and technology. Where do you you get your news?

- I keep informed of happenings through Hacker News, Twitter, and a well-stocked Feedly (comprised of Android Central, XDA-Developers, and Tech Crunch - to name a few).

The sane developer does things other than writing code. What else occupies your time?

- I love to cook and enjoy coming up with new dishes whenever I can. I also enjoy playing recreation sports or hiking and exploring new places. From early spring to late October, I follow baseball religiously and love visiting stadiums to catch a game. I also like to exercise my creative by shooting some night photography or light-painting photos from time to time.

The worldy developer is in touch with some form of culture (books, music, film, etc.). How do you go about feeding this part of your brain?

- In whatever way I can! I like to experience culture almost any way I can find it - sometimes that means reading a book about someone or something that I wouldn't gravitate to naturally and other times that means taking in either a lesser-known new film or classic work that I haven't seen before. I also like learning about and experiencing culture from other places around the world, especially through travel and hearing stories from people I meet first-hand.
