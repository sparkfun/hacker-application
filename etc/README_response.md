Please answer the following administrative/personal questions:

1. What is your desired compensation range? (Range meaning the least you're comfortable with to the most you think you're worth.)
	52,000-57,000, this is really negotiable, I'm looking for the right company that fits me and pay matters but people matter more along with the cause.
2. When can you start?
	I would love to leave this position with enough time to train the new guy a little so mid June, if this is unacceptable this could also change.
3. Do you have any planned vacations/absences in the next six months that we should know about?
	I'm a groomsman for a wedding on August 30th and I'll need a few days to fly back to attend that but nothing planned otherwise.
4. Do you have any problem with dogs?
	Not at all, currently dont have any pets.
5. Please describe one of the greatest costumes you've ever attempted, Halloween or otherwise.
	The lead character in the horror movie, the strangers.
6. The active developer keeps up on happenings in the world of development. Where do you you get your news?
	I have an ongoing rss feed with a large group of sites that cover all things hardware, development, consumer, music and cooking.
7. The sane developer does things besides write code. What occupies your time?
	I love messing around with audio and audio equipment, I have plans to design midi controllers, and LED sequencers that work with abelton.  I also have a large vinyl collection. So I go hunting (for vinyl) often, looking to find those rarity peices.
8. The worldy developer is in touch with some form of culture (books, movies, music, what have you). How do you go about feeding this part of your brain?
	Music is a must always, been that way since I was a little kid.  I attend as many shows possible, limited by money and time.  I read books but not as many as I want, most of them are manuals and schematics.  As for movies, I love horror films, action, thriller, I attend a few every month.
