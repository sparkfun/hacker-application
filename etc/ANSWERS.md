1. I think a good range for me would be between $70,000.00 to $75,000.00 per year.

2. Well if I actually got a job there then I would probably need a little time to get ready since I live in California. I could be ready in a month I think.

3. Nope, I don't have any vacations or absences planned.

4. Yes I really enjoy dogs! :) I'm used to working in an office where people would bring their dogs and I thought it was a treat. If I had a dog I'm not sure if I would bring them since I think I would worry too much about them potentially distracting others haha.

5. My main source for tech news right now is https://news.ycombinator.com. I feel like that site does an adequate job of keeping me informed about the newest tools/frameworks and how to get around paywalls! :)

6. When I'm not developing, I love to practice the drums and have been doing so since I was 11. Guitar, bass and piano are other instruments I also play. Mixing/producing music is another hobby I'm interested in. I like to go on walks/runs and just be aware of my surroundings. I practice mindfulness meditation and that's a wonderful way to be able to stay calm and break out of repetitive thinking cycles. I recently was into downloading NOAA satellite weather imagry data with a quadrifilar helix antenna I built out of PVC and I love just tinkering with odd gadgets even though that still deals with programming! :)

7. Hmmm I'm probably not doing well in this area right now. I listen to lots of forms of music (progressive, jazz, folk, metal, noise-rock, etc.) and I'm getting more into eastern melody writing. It's beautiful when mixed with western influences!

   I used to watch a lot of foreign films because I just seem to enjoy those more. I like reading subtitles! :) South Korean films seem to always have beautiful acoustic string textures. 

   Book reading I'm pretty bad at. I've conditioned myself to just be able to read computer books haha. I did however read one fictional book this year called The Little Prince. Good perspective on observing through a child's eyes.

8. I actually can't think of anything to critique about the site but I would fix the alignment of this button first hehe :D ![site picture](https://s3.amazonaws.com/kittypizza/Screenshot+from+2016-10-18+21%3A35%3A32.png).

   I tested on Firefox 49.0 and 49.0.1. 

   I really like the 3D view of products and that the coin for scale sometimes shows heads or tails! This product's 3D view appears not to be behaving though https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9299. A "materials is undefined" error. 

   Maybe I could work on some app that displays the products via augmented reality in front of the person so they could for example "see" an Arduino or RaspPi on their table and really understand the scale. Haha that might sound dumb but it would be cool if there was a way to do it using HTML 5 tech. Sorry I don't have much to critique. The site is really nice, easy to shop and has a great color scheme. Also it even seems to work well with javascript disabled! Good job! :D
