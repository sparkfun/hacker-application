What is your desired compensation range? (Range meaning the least you're comfortable with to the most you think you're worth.)
	- My desired compensation range would be between $40,000 - $60,000 a year. 

When can you start?
	- Though I graduated from school in December, I am finishing up one class which ends April 28th. So my earliest start date would be May 1st, 2013.

Do you have any planned vacations/absences in the next six months that we should know about?	
	- Nothing planned as of right now. I am very reliable when it comes to requesting time off and I am always sure to do so in a very timely manner.

Do you have any problem with dogs?
	- I absolutely LOVE dogs! And all animals for that matter!

Please describe one of the greatest costumes you've ever attempted, Halloween or otherwise.
	- I attempted to be Woody from Toy Story a couple years back. I made a large ring to tape to my back for the pull string and even wrote 
	"Andy" on the bottom of my boot! I have also dressed up as a big Budweiser can, but that wasn't nearly as creative as being Woody.

The active developer keeps up on happenings in the world of development. Where do you you get your news?
	- I really love Tech Crunch, Smashing Magazine, and TreeHouse. I follow all three news sources on a daily basis.

The sane developer does things besides write code. What occupies your time?
	- I am huge into extreme sports. I LOVE snowboarding and skateboarding in my free time. Of course video games are also a hobby of mine. 
	When I'm not programming, snowboarding, or skateboarding I can usually be found at a local bar with some good friends having a drink or two.

The worldy developer is in touch with some form of culture (books, movies, music, what have you). How do you go about feeding this part of your brain?
	- Well, as I have previously stated in my application I am actually a Film major at Western Michigan University. I love watching movies. Music is a huge part of my life as well. It's what keeps me moving through a rough day. I also enjoy reading a good book here and there. I haven't finished too many novels, but I always start and get at least half way through!
	
	
**SIDE NOTE**

	The application I posted in the 'code' directory is a beta version of a professional social network that I co-founded in 2011. That code is the live code running at http://beta.hirestarts.com. There is currently a network running at www.hirestarts.com, but it is an old version that I did not develop. 
	
	I look forward to hearing from you guys!
