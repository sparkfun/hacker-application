8. Please critique any of the SparkFun websites. With influence over the SparkFun dev team what would *you* focus on improving?
Ans. I browsed the website for 15-20 minutes, and here are few observations that I have.
-- Once we move to Forum tab, I didn't see a way to go back to main/home website. The user experience of Forum is quite differnet from say Shop, Learn. 
-- Filters on the left navigation bar, when clicked, reloads the web page. It will be good to see those expand without  web page being reloaded. Overall, I see couple of places where we may want to use AJAX.
-- There are opportunity to improve the website navigation.  From Feature point of view, I did see standard feature, eg. recommded product, chat links, etc. I am not sure how these are implemented, there should be improvement capabilities on the performance, searching etc.
