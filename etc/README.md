Please answer the following general questions:

1. What is your desired compensation range? (Range meaning the least you're comfortable with to the most you think you're worth.)

$98,000 - $135,000

2. When can you start?

I would require 2 weeks to complete my commitments with my current employer upon acceptance of the position. In addition, because I do not currently live in Colorado, I would need some time to find and move to at least a temporary location. Realistically, I think that 3-4 weeks would be sufficient.

3. Do you have any planned vacations/absences in the next six months that we should know about?

I have no vacations or absences planned for the next six months.

4. SparkFun is a dog-friendly environment. Are comfortable working around dogs? If you are a dog-owner, would you see yourself bringing dogs to work?

I love dogs, it's awesome you guys do this! Although I am not currently a dog-owner, I have been in the past, and want to become so once again. I would love to bring my dog to work with me, but only after we have developed a solid relationship and proper training and obedience are in place.

5. The active developer keeps up on happenings in the world of development and technology. Where do you you get your news?

I feel that staying up with the latest developments and happenings is a direct result of personal interest and activity within the field. As such, I tend to pull information from wherever I may find it. This may be a recommendation from a fellow developer or tech enthusiast, online classes/tutorials, conferences, lurking on the Freenode IRC channels, Reddit and its various sub-reddits, Stackoverflow, or any of the various  industry/technology-specific forums I occasionally frequent.

6. The sane developer does things other than writing code. What else occupies your time?

While I enjoy movies, books and other relaxing endeavors just as much as the next, I am also a constant tinkerer. I am usually working on a few personal projects that cover a gamut of interests, anywhere from gardening to 3D printing. I'm currently obsessed with FPV mini racing quads, I love the technical challenge of building them, the exhilaration of flying them, and the learning experience of crashing them. In addition I also enjoy getting out for a good show, or just a simple hike to enjoy mother nature.

7. The worldy developer is in touch with some form of culture (books, music, film, etc.). How do you go about feeding this part of your brain?

I am a firm believer that constant learning is vital for personal growth. While I believe that one can learn of culture from books and movies, the best way to really develop ones appreciation for culture is to go out and experience it. For this reason, I truly love to travel. It is through travel we are forced into uncomfortable situations, we are given the opportunity to see the world differently, to appreciate what we may take for granted, to learn by experience. Perhaps it is best illustrated with a quote from the movie "Good Will Hunting"

"So if I asked you about art, you'd probably give me the skinny on every art book ever written. Michelangelo, life's work, political aspirations, him and the pope, sexual orientations, the whole works. But I'll bet you can't tell me what it smells like in the Sistine Chapel. You've never actually stood there and looked up at that beautiful ceiling"

8. Please critique any of the SparkFun websites. With influence over the SparkFun dev team what would *you* focus on improving?

It's really difficult to effectively critique anything as complex as the SparkFun websites without first really understanding why and how things were put into place. That being said, lacking said knowledge I think there are a couple of main hurdles to address when dealing with a site of such substance. The first is making the sheer amount of data involved easily accessible.

One of the things I find difficult with the site is that it is so overwhelming. I know that data structuring is incredibly difficult but I think that you already have some really good ideas in place. I really like that in the 'store' the product pages contain links to applicable tutorials and resources in the 'learn' section. Additionally, the tag system implemented in the 'learn' section is quite useful and perhaps could be extended to work with the 'store' as well. The forum feels like a secondary addition to the site as a whole, it would be really nice if an additional signup/login account was not required. Perhaps there is a way to more elegantly/organically include the functionality and purpose of the forum into the 'learn' portion of the site.

In addition, while not a direct critique of the site, I also believe it is important to address the teams/individuals responsible for the creation and maintenance of the data. Again, I don't know how teams/individuals currently communicate with one another, but I would stress that all members best understand not only their role, but those of their co-workers. I think that organizations that empower all members to contribute are the most successful. It is important to remember that good ideas can come from anywhere, to embrace the fact that we are all both teachers and students.
