5. The active developer keeps up on happenings in the world of development and technology. Where do you you get your news?

A: I use feedly to keep up with sources like Wired, Prosethetic Knowledge, Tech Crunch, Rhizome, Mashable, Co.Design, and Tech Radar. I use twitter to keep up with institutions, bloggers, celeberities, academics, thinkers, etc. Examples: MIT Media Lab, Lauren McCarthy, Ian Bogost, Jen Myers, and more. 

6. The sane developer does things other than writing code. What else occupies your time?

7. The worldy developer is in touch with some form of culture (books, music, film, etc.). How do you go about feeding this part of your brain?

A: My media diet consists of the following: 40% many many quality TV shows on various streaming services, 30% Highly theoretical artistic and cultural critique for grad school, 20% general internet consumption (vlogs, podcasts, articles, etc) 10% RuPaul's Drag Race


8. Please critique any of the SparkFun websites. With influence over the SparkFun dev team what would *you* focus on improving?

A: I'd be most interested in improving the educational section. THere's a weird flow to it currently that I think could be improved. Like on the Start a Project page (https://learn.sparkfun.com/start_a_project) the content is organized by content type. There aren't even any videos, so that's a bummer section there. The user is probably coming to the page looking for categories of projects they could make. They're looking for inspiration, and that isn't really dependent on content TYPE. Someone wants to come to that page and see "LEARN HOW TO MAKE ROBOTS" or "MAKE AWESOME COSPLAY". It could vary by skill level also, because a more experienced user who wants to try a new technology is gonna wanna see different stuff than someone who doesn't even know what's possible.
