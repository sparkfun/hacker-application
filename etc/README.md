Please answer the following general questions:

1. When can you start?

  ASAP!

2. Do you have any planned vacations/absences in the next six months that we should know about?

  Yes. My family has rented a cabin in Lake Tahoe for the entire month of June. My plan was to go for about two weeks but I have not yet bought tickets due to the job hunt. Equally as vague, My friends are getting married in in August. I do not know the date yet but this would most likely be a long weekend.

3. SparkFun is a dog-friendly environment. Are comfortable working around dogs? If you are a dog-owner, would you see yourself bringing dogs to work?

  I love dogs! Not a dog owner myself but have no problem working with them.

4. The active developer keeps up on happenings in the world of development and technology. Where do you you get your news?

  I get my tech news form the Galvanize's news letters, various slack channel meet up groups, reddit's technews channel and the BBC.

5. The sane developer does things other than writing code. What else occupies your time?

  I love to cook. I play at Boulder Indoor Soccer twice a week. I am building a terrarium to house a chameleon. I love playing board games and as the snow melts I will be taking my kayak out on some rivers.

6. The worldy developer is in touch with some form of culture (books, music, film, etc.). How do you go about feeding this part of your brain?

  I love studying and playing chess. Lately I have been into learning more about WWII through documentaries. I listen to the BBC, Democracy Now and npr Politics for news. Currently I am reading 'City of Thieves' by David Benioff, a fictional story about the siege of Leningrad.

7. Please critique any of the SparkFun websites. With influence over the SparkFun dev team what would *you* focus on improving?

  One thing I noticed is that every time something is changed (route, filter, login, logout, page pagination) the whole page seems to refresh. If you watch the network tab when any variable is changed, you see all the same things reloading including  jquery cdns, scripts and jpgs. If the internet connection is poor, this causes the user lots of an unnecessary wait time. For sparkFun, I imagine that this causes redundant requests being made to your servers over and over again. A possible solution, maybe even a way to save a bit of money as a result of decreasing the workload on your servers, would be to utilize a single page application architecture using a framework like React or Angular. This would allow the page to load all ui at the beginning and only make request to the server when new information is needed. I pretty good with React and Angular, maybe I could help...
