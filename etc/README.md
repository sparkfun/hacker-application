Please answer the following general questions:

1. What is your desired compensation range? (Range meaning the least you're comfortable with to the most you think you're worth.)
My desired compensation range is between $125k - $150k although I understand this is on the high side.  My career goal is to work up to a managerial/C-level position which allows me to both get my hands dirty in code and make a true impact by managing multiple projects/programs on the business end. 

2. When can you start?
I can start within 4 weeks of receiving an offer.  

3. Do you have any planned vacations/absences in the next six months that we should know about?
No

4. SparkFun is a dog-friendly environment. Are comfortable working aroung dogs? If you are a dog-owner, would you see yourself bringing dogs to work?
I am a believer in the healing power of pets!  I have three cats and no dogs, but I'm comfortable working around dogs as long as they are well-behaved.

5. The active developer keeps up on happenings in the world of development and technology. Where do you you get your news?
Recode.net 
Reddit.com/r/coding - Often uncovers other great sources of news/information
Occasionally: Joel on Software, Paul Graham

6. The sane developer does things other than writing code. What else occupies your time?
When not working, I am  involved in volunteer efforts such as beach cleanups and all manner of physical fitness including strength training, running and climbing.  I am also a founding member of TEDxHoboken.  TEDx is an international community that organizes TED-style events anywhere and everywhere and in this case it is in Hoboken, NJ.  Additionally, I founded a group called NYC PR Innovators that is a free to join group that encourages networking and education within the PR community.

7. The worldy developer is in touch with some form of culture (books, music, film, etc.). How do you go about feeding this part of your brain?
My husband and I are part of a movie group that meets on many Saturdays. The movie genres may range from modern blockbusters to niche indie films to old campy sci-fi movies.

8. Please critique any of the SparkFun websites. With influence over the SparkFun dev team what would *you* focus on improving?
I chose the Learn website to critique.  It's easy to spot bugs, so I will do that first:
https://learn.sparkfun.com/blog - The tags really hurt the eyes!  They're also not increasing according to frequency, so I would either change the sizing of the tags or change the color to be less contrasting with the background.  As I type this, I'm still seeing spots in my eyes!

Also on https://learn.sparkfun.com/blog, the SUBSCRIBE TO EDUCATOR NEWSLETTER button is off by 1px in Chrome and way off in Firefox.

Suggestions for improvements on the business side:
As a complete novice to electronics and robotics, I would want to see a line of tutorials that are geared toward people who have no prior experience.  When I searched the site for "beginner", I found 28 tutorials, but none of them seem to start with the basics.  Well, one explained all about electricity but it doesn't get me started making something cool.  

There may be an opportunity here for a set of lessons on beginning electronics, perhaps geared for a teacher.  SparkFun could bundle a set of products that allows the teacher and his/her students to create something from scratch and learn along the way.  

I noticed there are no upcoming classes! Obviously, I don't know the business reason behind this (maybe SparkFun doesn't hold classes in the Winter?), but you may want to consider recording classes taught by an electronics professional and allow people to sign up for scheduled e-classes. If you're familiar with course websites like Udemy and Coursera, the teacher will record lectures which can be watched by the students at any time. During the time a class is "in-session", the teacher will be available to communicate with students and answer any questions they have on the class forum.

Lastly, I believe in reaping what you sow, so I spend as much of my time as possible giving back to communities that have helped me. I wonder if SparkFun could host a community workshop and/or donate product to children/schools who may not be able to afford them otherwise.  

These suggestions may help increase business and product sales on SparkFun as well as drive name recognition with the right PR and marketing.
