Please answer the following administrative/personal questions:

1. What is your desired compensation range? (Range meaning the least you're comfortable with to the most you think you're worth.)

I would feel comfortable being paid in the range of $50,000-57,000. This range is below what is mentioned in the job description only because my current area of experties is desktop application development.

2. When can you start?

Immediately, although May 1 is better and May 25 is best. However I can make most things work.

3. Do you have any planned vacations/absences in the next six months that we should know about?

In mid-July I am scheduled to teach for a week in California at a music camp for high school students, which I have done for the past 3 years. I was also planning a US tour with my laptop quartet but that can be rearranged to not be an issue.

4. Do you have any problem with dogs?

I love dogs. My family had a German Short Hair Pointer growing up. I currently have two cats but that is mainly because I live in an apartment.

5. Please describe one of the greatest costumes you've ever attempted, Halloween or otherwise.

Ack, you picked the ONE nerdy area that I'm not really big on. It's not that I'm opposed to costumes: just that I'm not often in situations which require one. I routinely wear a tuxedo to a monthly super pretentious dinner party. Back in high school for a performance I had to go punk/goth (NOT my normal MO by any means). In third grade I was Captain Picard (albeit with more hair) with a 100% home made costume (thanks to my awesome parents).

6. The active developer keeps up on happenings in the world of development. Where do you you get your news?

A fair amount of the time I hear about new developments through my other programming friends or simply by googling around. Typically when working on a project I start with a search for what I'm working on, even if I've done it before. That way if there's some hot new library or fancy API update I can find it rather quickly. Being Facebook and Google+ friends with other developers also tends to bring things to my attention.

7. The sane developer does things besides write code. What occupies your time?

As you could probably guess from my various degrees, I compose and perform music. That quite often (but not always) involves writing code as well. Other less professionally oriented activities I enjoy are home brewing, pretending that I'm a gourmet chef, hiking, and gaming.

8. The worldy developer is in touch with some form of culture (books, movies, music, what have you). How do you go about feeding this part of your brain?

I would like to think I'm pretty familliar with music (to the point where it doesn't really count for this question). I enjoy watching comedy (Portlandia is a current favorite of mine) and smart dramas. Can't wait for the next Hobbit and Star Trek movie! I do like reading but I'm it takes me longer than I would like to get through anything substantial so it's not particularly high on my list of activities. Theater and dance performances are two things that I enjoy but unfortunately rarely get to.
