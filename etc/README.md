Please answer the following general questions:

1. What is your desired compensation range? (Range meaning the least you're comfortable with to the most you think you're worth.)

* $60,000-$80,000 per year

2. When can you start?

* Immediately, granting 2 weeks to give notice to my current employer.

3. Do you have any planned vacations/absences in the next six months that we should know about?

* None planned at this time.

4. SparkFun is a dog-friendly environment. Are comfortable working aroung dogs? If you are a dog-owner, would you see yourself bringing dogs to work?

* I have an adorable little Australian Cattle-dog (more of a mutt, but sweet as could be) that I would love to bring into the office.

5. The active developer keeps up on happenings in the world of development and technology. Where do you you get your news?

* Primarily Reddit, I follow a number of different programming subreddits, mostly /r/php, /r/java, and /r/programming

6. The sane developer does things other than writing code. What else occupies your time?

* I love working on cars, I'm a huge gearhead. I also enjoy making chainmail things, mostly dice bags for friends and fellow Dungeons and Dragons games. I enjoy getting outdoors, hiking, and seeing the world.

7. The worldy developer is in touch with some form of culture (books, music, film, etc.). How do you go about feeding this part of your brain?

* Typically film, I'm a huge fan of documentaries over almost any subject, especially if it has David Attenborough's voice narrating. Music as well, almost anything with a smooth but heavy beat.

8. Please critique any of the SparkFun websites. With influence over the SparkFun dev team what would *you* focus on improving?

* I don't know that I can find much to criticize on the surface, the site is quick, simple, clean, and has an easy to use interface. But there's always a few more microseconds to squeeze somewhere. If I was given free reign I'd learn the code inside and out, working to find any new little place to save a few seconds, or some new plugin to offload processing of any data to the clients. Optimize tables, refactor classes, and offload every possible resource to a reliable CDN.
