Please answer the following administrative/personal questions:

1. What is your desired compensation range? (Range meaning the least you're comfortable with to the most you think you're worth.)

62k - 70k

2. When can you start?

Once I have an offer letter I need two weeks to hand off projects at my current job and a Week to get out there.  My current employer is aware of my 
desire to relocate as well.

3. Do you have any planned vacations/absences in the next six months that we should know about?

Nope

4. Do you have any problem with dogs?

I love dogs and I plan on getting a bulldog that I will name Caroline and hopefully will be able to bring with me to work if you guys hire me!

5. Please describe one of the greatest costumes you've ever attempted, Halloween or otherwise.

Easy, Price is Right Contestant.  I cut construction paper to make a name tag and a score board to hang around my neck.  I had hung portable speakers
around my neck connected to an iPod so I could have my friend announce my arrival and then run into the party blaring the theme music and triumphetly
waving my arms like a boss.  Part 2 of why this was the greatest costume ever was since I had speakers, my group had music blaring everywhere we walked,
so basically what happened was I ended up starting a dance party in the middle of the streets of State College, PA.  Good times at Penn State.

6. The active developer keeps up on happenings in the world of development. Where do you you get your news?

KnockMeOut, CNET, /r/programming, /r/webdev

7. The sane developer does things besides write code. What occupies your time?

I golf, bowl, play paintball, trying to start snowboarding again, fish, hunt, hike, kayak, play guitar, mandolin, drums, poker, video games, anything really that
sounds like it could be remotely fun.  I'm pretty open when it comes to trying new things, going new places, and meeting new people.

8. The worldy developer is in touch with some form of culture (books, movies, music, what have you). How do you go about feeding this part of your brain?

I surround myself by music constantly. I just started playing drums this year, so I'm usually playing them for at least two hours a day.  If I'm going to read something
it'll probably be some form of comic like the Maus series.  Not like the traditional super hero stuff though.  Except Batman, nobody argues with justice.
I watch a lot of movies, and a fun hobby I have is finding that absolute most aweful looking cheesy movie I can find on Netflix.  2 Headed Shark Attack is 
probably getting watched tonight.
