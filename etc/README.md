Please answer the following general questions:

1. What is your desired compensation range? (Range meaning the least you're comfortable with to the most you think you're worth.)  My desired range would hover around $150k, within that there is some room to wiggle of course.

2. When can you start?  As soon as you are ready.

3. Do you have any planned vacations/absences in the next six months that we should know about?  No plans at this time.

4. SparkFun is a dog-friendly environment. Are comfortable working aroung dogs? If you are a dog-owner, would you see yourself bringing dogs to work?  I have three dogs myself and have brought dogs into office environments for a long time.  My wife and I have an interesting mix, a 13 year old Golden Retriever,  an 11 year old Chihuahua, and a 1 year old burner.  

5. The active developer keeps up on happenings in the world of development and technology. Where do you you get your news?  I'm a very active news troll.  Most of my updates come via Twitter (Mashable, SciencePorn, RMI, Ignite), Facebook (Venture Beat, I (something) Love Science), LinkedIn, FlipBoard (Entrepreneurship, Mobile).  I also love to network and talk to others in the technology field.  

6. The sane developer does things other than writing code. What else occupies your time?  For 13 years I was very active in the Mountain Rescue community, lately I spend my time raising 5 children and taking my wife out on dates.  Travel is very important to me as well.  We have deemed Costa Rica as our Nirvana and love to travel there to surf and explore.

7. The worldy developer is in touch with some form of culture (books, music, film, etc.). How do you go about feeding this part of your brain?  Books have traditionally been my source of culture.  Last book I read was And the Mountains Echoled, currently I'm working on Unmanned: A novel, I frequently reference Practical Paleo for cooking ideas.  My current goal is to learn Spanish via Rosetta Stone so I don't feel like such a chump when traveling to Costa Rica.

8. Please critique any of the SparkFun websites. With influence over the SparkFun dev team what would *you* focus on improving?  I really like the clean (responsive) design of the sites.  For a online retailer I am a fan of ease in order for someone to buy the product they are there for.  Navigating is easy and doesn't take many clicks.  Going between the different sites is easy from the base domain.  One thing that I found odd was that the Forum and and Data subdomains do not have the same tabbed format as Shop, Learn, and AVC.  This may be by design but it seems someone could not easily navigate back to the main domain in order to buy product.

Using PHPBB might be the limiting factor in maintaining the same look and feel as the main domain but this could be by design and intent as it is a forum.  

The Data site does not have the company logo as the other sites do, it maintains a very clean design but not having the logo doesn't immediately identify it visually as a SparkFun site.
