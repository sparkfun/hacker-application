Please answer the following general questions:

1. What is your desired compensation range? (Range meaning the least you're comfortable with to the most you think you're worth.)

105-120K

2. When can you start?

As soon as needed.

3. Do you have any planned vacations/absences in the next six months that we should know about?

I have a family event on Monday, Feb. 13th.

4. SparkFun is a dog-friendly environment. Are comfortable working aroung dogs? If you are a dog-owner, would you see yourself bringing dogs to work?

Yes, I love dogs. Unfortunately, I cannot bring my dog, she was a rescue and isn't comfortable with other animals.

5. The active developer keeps up on happenings in the world of development and technology. Where do you you get your news?

I would say mostly techcrunch and mashable but also linkedin and other varying sources. 

6. The sane developer does things other than writing code. What else occupies your time?

I play guitar and bass. I am currently playing bass for a classic rock band.

7. The worldy developer is in touch with some form of culture (books, music, film, etc.). How do you go about feeding this part of your brain?

For music I use streaming services like Pandora and Jango. For books I mostly read them the old fashioned way.

8. Please critique any of the SparkFun websites. With influence over the SparkFun dev team what would *you* focus on improving?

When you click the forum or data tabs on https://learn.sparkfun.com/, you lose the navigation bar. I imagine these are separate applications 
but it might be nice if this was more seamless and less disjointed.
