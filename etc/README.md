Please answer the following administrative/personal questions:

* What is your desired compensation range? (Range meaning the least you're comfortable with to the most you think you're worth.)

$50k to 65k

* When can you start?

At the end of this month. I will have to relocate so some planning will need to go into that as well.

* Do you have any planned vacations/absences in the next six months that we should know about?

No

* Do you have any problem with dogs?

Absolutely not! I love dogs!

* Please describe one of the greatest costumes you've ever attempted, Halloween or otherwise.

I'm not huge on dressing up. That said, my mom was always very into costumes so when I was younger I dressed up for every Halloween. The best one was probably the rabbit from Alice and Wonderland.

* The active developer keeps up on happenings in the world of development. Where do you you get your news?

Some websites I frequent: Reddit, Gizmodo, Lifehacker, XKCD. I idle a couple irc channels: #google, #git ... #sparkfun, #reprap ;).

* The sane developer does things besides write code. What occupies your time?

I have a ton of hobbies. I am a maker, I have a 3D Printer and I love tinkering with electronics. I have a few micro RC helicopters. This past winter was my second snowboarding season!

* The worldy developer is in touch with some form of culture (books, movies, music, what have you). How do you go about feeding this part of your brain?

I like to blow out entire seasons of tv shows in a weekend (GO NETFLIX!). I stay generally up to date with movies. I go out to see about 8-9 a year. I haven't read much in the past few years but I am trying to get back into it. Currently reading Homeland.
