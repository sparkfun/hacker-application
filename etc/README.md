Please answer the following general questions:

1. What is your desired compensation range? (Range meaning the least you're comfortable with to the most you think you're worth.)

$115,000 - $150,000.  In my current position, I’m making $125,000.  In my position at mShopper I was making $150,000.  My consulting rate is typically $75 - $90/hr.  Compensation is not one of my main motivators.  Company culture, having fun, and enjoying the people and what I do are more important.  However, I wish to be paid reasonably for my talent and what I bring to the company.


2. When can you start?

I can start 2 weeks from when I accept the job offer.


3. Do you have any planned vacations/absences in the next six months that we should know about?

No, not at this time.


4. SparkFun is a dog-friendly environment. Are comfortable working aroung dogs? If you are a dog-owner, would you see yourself bringing dogs to work?

I love dogs and being around dogs.  Currently I do not have a dog, but that may change in the future.  If that changes, I might consider bringing my dog to work on occasion.  I have worked in several dog-friendly environments and have always enjoyed it.


5. The active developer keeps up on happenings in the world of development and technology. Where do you you get your news?

I subscribe to a number of different groups on LinkedIn.  I also attend the Boulder/Denver New Tech meetups (lately the Fort Collins meeting more than the Boulder one, but Boulder is still my favorite).  I’m a big fan of TED talks.


6. The sane developer does things other than writing code. What else occupies your time?

My life is a triangle of work, family, and personal/hobbies.  Each having about the same weight.  I like to spend lots of time with my kids and wife.  We hike, bike, travel, play games and try to generally have fun together.  My personal/hobbies area include reading, radio control planes, personal improvement (working out, yoga, etc.), flying (I’m a private pilot), and volunteering with the Civil Air Patrol.

I’m an active volunteer member of the Civil Air Patrol, United States Air Force Auxiliary. Holding the rank of Captain, I currently serve in the roles of Deputy Commander for Seniors, Assistant Personnel Officer, Assistant Aerospace Education Officer and Maintenance Officer of the Thompson Valley Composite Squadron. In Civil Air Patrol, I use his passion of flying, to fly search and rescue and disaster recovery missions for national and local disasters, lost hikers and airborne photography missions. I’ve flown missions for Hurricane Katrina, the Atlanta Tornado (2008), Colorado High Park, Black Forest and Waldo Canyon fires and the Colorado floods (2013). As a Cadet Orientation Pilot, I introduce CAP Cadets to the thrill of flight; the Cadet Orientation Flight Program introduces youth to general aviation through hands-on orientation flights in single engine aircraft.


7. The worldy developer is in touch with some form of culture (books, music, film, etc.). How do you go about feeding this part of your brain?

I like to read, listen to music, watch films, enjoy Broadway plays, classical concerts, and opera.  I like most styles of music, but listen mostly to Country, Classical, Pop and Folk.  I currently am reading a book called “Drop Dead Healthy” by A.J. Jacobs.  I also have subscriptions to several magazines oriented around Flying.
