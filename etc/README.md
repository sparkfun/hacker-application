Please answer the following general questions:

1. When can you start?
    >I can start as soon as April 3, 2017.

2. Do you have any planned vacations/absences in the next six months that we should know about?
    >I have nothing planned as of right now.

3. SparkFun is a dog-friendly environment. Are comfortable working around dogs? If you are a dog-owner, would you see yourself bringing dogs to work?
    >Absolutely. I love dogs. My previous place of work allowed dogs as well.

4. The active developer keeps up on happenings in the world of development and technology. Where do you you get your news?
    >Medium and Quora are my top sites for staying informed on development trends. I also really enjoy attending well organized Ruby and Javascript Meetups to get news and learn new things.

5. The sane developer does things other than writing code. What else occupies your time?
    >I'm an avid backpaker--my favorite thing to do is explore a new landscape. I also play a lot of guitar, read, and stream movies or shows.

6. The worldly developer is in touch with some form of culture (books, music, film, etc.). How do you go about feeding this part of your brain?
    >I read before bed most nights. As for music, I like to stream Radioparadise through a good set of headphones. I've been turned on to so much music through Radioparadise. I definitely watch a lot of film and shows through streaming services.

7. Please critique any of the SparkFun websites. With influence over the SparkFun dev team what would *you* focus on improving?
    >It appears that SparkFun might have discontinued their newsletter service but left the sign-up form in the DOM. It's a 3rd party, embedded React plugin from HubSpot. The form will gladly submit your email address (and even perform a validation), but I've yet to receive a newsletter or even an email confirmation.

    >The search bar is under-sold. I dismissed it when I saw where it was but then was pleasantly surprised to see a dropdown populate with items that matched my string as I typed. This is a very useful feature that might deserve better real estate.

    >My forte is React/Redux, so with influence over the dev team, my focus would be to help transition the stack over to a MERN stack with Redux.

    >By the way, I like the reference to the film *Sneakers* in the email verification element:
    "...my voice is my passport."
