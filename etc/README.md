Please answer the following general questions:

1. What is your desired compensation range? (Range meaning the least you're comfortable with to the most you think you're worth.)

$55k - $65k. Yes, I got that from the ad. And I realize it sounds like a cop-out but to me, it's the only correct answer. I would not
feel comfortable with a company advertising a salary range and then offering me less than their low amount; nor would I feel good
about starting off the discussion by claiming that I think I'm worth more than your high number.

2. When can you start?

Possibly by next week, surely before next month. I am in Monterey, planning to relocate- it is not so much that me starting work
is contingent on when I can be in Boulder; rather how soon I can be in Boulder depends on first securing a job there.

3. Do you have any planned vacations/absences in the next six months that we should know about?

Nope.

4. SparkFun is a dog-friendly environment. Are you comfortable working around dogs? If you are a dog-owner, would you see yourself bringing dogs to work?

Very comfortable, I have worked in dog grooming salons in the past. We do have one dog, a short-hair border collie / lab mix-
 I would probably not bring him to work often if at all because he is old, nearly deaf and likes to wander off.

5. The active developer keeps up on happenings in the world of development and technology. Where do you you get your news?

Where would I go anymore to not get my news? The most interesting news story I've read recently was an article from Google about
running image recognition algorithms backwards to make a neural network generate imagery; and that was a link from a tweet that
popped up in my email on my phone in the middle of being out of town for 5 days (and on top of a high desert hill at the time.)
And the most recent interesting tech news stories- not quite the same thing- that I've read are that a U.S. vs. Japan giant robot
battle is on for next year and that hoverbikes are not far from commercial availability.

I read Wired and Smithsonian and Scientific American and sometimes the New Yorker and The Week; online, read Boing Boing and
Stack Overflow and all of the Reddits.

6. The sane developer does things other than writing code. What else occupies your time?

Eliza, age 5, and Jude, age 9m. The two are an expert team of time-occupiers. They also consume most of my available sanity.
And writing code, fortunately, is one of the things that helps keep me sane. Art is another; I've been short on both free time and
inspiration for a long time, but want to make room in my life to draw, paint and build stuff again.
In Oregon I did metal jewelry and glass mosaics. When possible, I go hiking on trails in the parks or to the beach.
Living in Boulder, I would certainly get back into snowboarding.

7. The worldy developer is in touch with some form of culture (books, music, film, etc.). How do you go about feeding this part of your brain?

I will listen to whatever music unless it is horrible. ( If it's contemporary pop, it's horrible. ) The genre that I most enjoy that most
people don't: all the non-easily-danceable electronica ( IDM / folktronica / glitch-hop / whatever ). Used to read a lot of science fiction
books and stories. Not so much now. Douglas Adams; Douglas Hofstadter, Vonnegut, Orwell, Dr.Seuss, Gary Larson, Bill Watterson...
It's been a long time since I went to see live music. Âµ-ziq, Air? Did recently catch Dana Carvey's standup routine, though. I don't know- I like pretty much all the things someone demographically similar to me could be predicted to like by a sufficiently advanced AI.

7.5 The penitent developer...

...kneels! [ *snikkt* *whooossh* ]

8. Please critique any of the SparkFun websites. With influence over the SparkFun dev team what would *you* focus on improving?

Couple of things... The learning site- medium layout- between 584px and 604px wide, breaks out of alignment. The medium (iPad / phablet) layout in general is less developed than the large and small.
The forum page. Doesn't look bad, just looks very 'defaulty', it could be better integrated with the look of the site.
Not sure how easily customizable the forum is but even those select inputs and Google calendars can be forced into a consistent
site style if you pound on them hard enough.

In general- I am not a big fan of the flat-and-minimal look that we're all doing now until someone has a better idea. It does look
good, but it also looks kind of like everything else- and once everything has gone all out flat and minimalist and everybody had
become tired of it, where does it go from there?
