Please answer the following administrative/personal questions:

1. What is your desired compensation range? (Range meaning the least you're comfortable with to the most you think you're worth.)
A)  I would be very happy with 40k to 50k, I'm not as experienced as some, but eager to learn!

4. Do you have any problem with dogs?
A) love dogs. And cats. And squirrels. (the last make horrible pets) 

5. Please describe one of the greatest costumes you've ever attempted, Halloween or otherwise.
A) I didn't have a costume one year, and my friends wanted to go out so I went to the local hardware store, got a touch light, put in some blue LED's, threw on a suit and became tony stark :) I've also been gambit from the X-men, made a glowing red card.

6. The active developer keeps up on happenings in the world of development. Where do you you get your news?
A) Other hackers, friends, IRC, reddit, sparkfun, hackaday, hackaweek, engadget(rarely these days) the onion, XKCD, and many others I might not have listed here. I also am an avid twitter..er. I get a lot of my news from other people with the same mindset as me.

7. The sane developer does things besides write code. What occupies your time?
A) I am a maker. I'm in the process of starting a local hackerspace http://minotmakers.com and I've participated in a few build competitions like the RedBull challenge (http://minotmakers.com/projects/bullduino-project-post/) and I'm always making or fixing something. I also rebuild engines when I have time, I've rebuilt the engine in my truck ('79 chevy) and the engine in my motorcycle ('86 yamaha V-twin).

8. The worldy developer is in touch with some form of culture (books, movies, music, what have you). How do you go about feeding this part of your brain?
A) I love movies. I don't watch much TV but when I do, I normally sit down with an entire season. I read, mostly main stream stuff, and I'm always listening to music. When I'm coding, the music genre is techno/dubstep or movie sound tracks. Music with words can be distracting for me at times, but I enjoy hard rock/ metal when I'm not coding. I'm also a cigar smoker, and beer connoisseur.. I always get a micro brew or something local to the area when I travel. Also (started because of the beer consumption) I've found a new love for running.
