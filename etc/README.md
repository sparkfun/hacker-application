Please answer the following general questions:

1. When can you start?

I am available to start immediately as of March 20th.

2. Do you have any planned vacations/absences in the next six months that we should know about?

I do not have any planned vacations/absences in the next six months.  

3. SparkFun is a dog-friendly environment. Are comfortable working around dogs? If you are a dog-owner, would you see yourself bringing dogs to work?

I am comfortable working around dogs and have a dog of my own.  While not something I would do regularly, I enjoy having the option to bring my dog to work and would likely bring him in on occasion.

4. The active developer keeps up on happenings in the world of development and technology. Where do you you get your news?

The Galvanize community hosts events that provide me with a substantial amount of news, as well as other information on emerging trends and new technologies in the industry.  Additionally, our daily stand up included time for interesting events and happenings in the industry, and was often very enlightening.  In addition to the resources at Galvanize, I use social websites such as reddit to get new and exciting news from the tech industry.  Word of mouth is also incredible powerful and many casual discussions have led to me doing research on the previously discussed topic.  For example, a friend of mine introduced me to 21.co.  Which, among other things, provides software that empowers bitcoin micropayements by http request.  Simply checking in on the 21.co website periodically yields information on news and updates regarding crytpocurrencies and micropayements.

5. The sane developer does things other than writing code. What else occupies your time?

When not coding I enjoy skiing, climbing, and mountaineering.  I believe that outdoor experiences refresh the mind and recharge ones capacity for devout focus on code.  I personally enjoy spending time being active outdoors and am particularly fond of adventures that have a technical problem solving twist.   I draw parallels between writing code and the technical skills harnessed by climbers and backcountry skiers.  Another parallel I've observed is an eagerness to mentor, share information, and contribute to the progress of others.  When I first started climbing I was surrounded by people who wanted to share their knowledge with me.  Since I have begun to feel accomplished in the craft, I am happy to pass along what I know to others who are eager to learn.  I find that when I appear to come to a road block in either coding or outdoor sports,  I can find inspiration and refuge in the other.  This results in a synergistic effect of perpetual inspiration, challenge, and success.  However, not every recreational endeavor must be challenging and technical, I also enjoy spending time with my friends and my dog, going to concerts, tubing down Boulder Creek, and exploring the science fiction genre.  

6. The worldy developer is in touch with some form of culture (books, music, film, etc.). How do you go about feeding this part of your brain?

I am very fond of science fiction books and movies.  In terms of movies, the original Star Wars trilogy will forever be one of my favorites.  I also grew up watching copious amounts of Star Trek with my father and, as such, will forever be a fan of that fictional universe.  In terms of books,  Ray Bradbury's Martian Chronicles, as well as his other more popular books, are high on my list.  Additionally, a new discovery, Isaac Asimov's Foundation Series, has quickly worked its way into being one of my favorites as well.  Outside of science fiction I enjoy the literature and poetry of the transcendentalists, as well as, the beat poets and their disciples.  For example, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Walt Whitman, Jack Kerouac, and Edward Abbey all come to mind as dear favorites.  My musical tastes gravitate toward classical rock and folk, such as Bob Dylan, the Lumineers, and the Grateful Dead.  I also have an interest in history, particularly local history, and I have spent many hours pouring over wikipedia.  It can be very enlightening to learn about how places came to be what they are today, as well as interesting events that occurred along the way.  Denver and Boulder have captivating histories that are very worth investigating.   

7. Please critique any of the SparkFun websites. With influence over the SparkFun dev team what would *you* focus on improving?

If I where to put forward any critique it would be better integration between learn.sparkfun.com and sparkfun.com.  I hesitate to write this both because I am throughly impressed by these websites and because they contain a wealth of knowledge that could take years to properly internalize.  Still, I think that more could be done to cater toward the absolute beginner.  This could be alleviated by including references to the Arduino and Electric Imp documentation or by excessive use of smaller code snippets in articles.  For example, when trying to set up a SparkFun soil moisture sensor I read in the hook up guide to use a digital pin for prolonged life.  I was eventually able to configure it in this way, but as someone who was relatively new to Arduino, it was not readily apparent how to accomplish this.  Small fragmented portions of code could lay this out.  I do think that there is value in having to do some "detective work" and that a better understanding can be obtained by spending time looking at Arduino's documentation that can not be reproduced in a snippet of code.  However, this is an aspect that I would focus on improving if I had influence over the SparkFun dev team.
