Please answer the following general questions:

1. What is your desired compensation range? (Range meaning the least you're comfortable with to the most you think you're worth.)

Least => $80k

Most => $100k

2. When can you start?

I can start now if you let me telecomute until I'm able to relocate. (Give me a few weeks. 
The two biggest things are selling my bike and breaking up with my dentist. She's cute, but I can't do the long distance thing. Especially when it comes to dentists.)

3. Do you have any planned vacations/absences in the next six months that we should know about?

Yes, I plan to go to Colorado on an indefinite vacation from New Jersey.
Also I have braces so there's that.
I probably should have a regular checkup.

4. SparkFun is a dog-friendly environment. Are comfortable working around dogs? If you are a dog-owner, would you see yourself bringing dogs to work?

I see myself getting a dog just to take advantage of this.

5. The active developer keeps up on happenings in the world of development and technology. Where do you you get your news?

I don't like to use new tools until they're stable or I desparately need them.

I follow business news:

Business Insider

Techcrunch

INC

Meetup.com Developer/business/makerspace classes (¡Mucho Excelente!)

Job postings help to get a general idea of what's in demand.

6. The sane developer does things other than writing code. What else occupies your time?

Girls, motorcycles, um um um….code  *puts on shades in dark room trying to look cool. walks into wall*

7. The worldly developer is in touch with some form of culture (books, music, film, etc.). How do you go about feeding this part of your brain?

Books are a certain break from the indefinitely decreasing attention span that jumping from one article to another on the internet 
seems to create. I enjoy reading about business, making stuff, fixing stuff and how brains work.

8. Please critique any of the SparkFun websites. With influence over the SparkFun dev team what would *you* focus on improving?

Live footage of tiny robots disassembling cars. Also tiny robot chopshops. And tiny robot mob bosses. And tiny robot policemen. And jails. And and and...
