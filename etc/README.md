Please answer the following general questions:

1. What is your desired compensation range? (Range meaning the least you're comfortable with to the most you think you're worth.)
	* Negotiable

2. When can you start?
	* As soon as possible. I will need some time to find a place to stay and a bit
		of time move.

3. Do you have any planned vacations/absences in the next six months that we should know about?
	* I'd like to be in Kansas City for Thanksgiving so I can visit family. My
		sister, brother-in-law, and kids are planning to come up from Alabama.

4. SparkFun is a dog-friendly environment. Are comfortable working around dogs? If you are a dog-owner, would you see yourself bringing dogs to work?
	* One of my previous jobs had 2 cats that lived in the office. I got a puppy
		near the end of High School and he lived a happy life. I've taken care of
		friends' cats & dogs over the years so no problems.

5. The active developer keeps up on happenings in the world of development and technology. Where do you you get your news?
	* I hang out on freenode.org in #kclug, #tulsalug, #phpc (PHP Community), and
		##club-nomicon. I sometimes help in ##php. I found out about Heartbleed,
		POODLE, FREAK, Logjam, and a couple of others the day everybody found out
		about them, updated what services I could, and notified people in charge
		of services I wasn't able to fix.
	* I'm subscribed to 2600 Hacker Quarterly on my Kindle.
	* I also like going to conferences like PHP|Tek.

6. The sane developer does things other than writing code. What else occupies your time?

	* Playing games and sometimes streaming them live on Twitch.tv.
	* Reading science fiction books and watching Anime.
	* I've been learning to play a bass via Rocksmith 2014.
	* Riding my bicycle.
	* If I can find a tennis half-court with a wall I'll play a terrible game of
		tennis against myself.
	* If somebody has a ball I don't mind kicking a soccer ball or hacky sack
		around or shooting some hoops.
	* Fishing whether out in a boat on a lake with friends or on a river.

7. The worldly developer is in touch with some form of culture (books, music, film, etc.). How do you go about feeding this part of your brain?

	* Road trips - I like road trips in general, but the Mini Cooper Takes the
		States 2014 was absolutely awesome (especially with the team from
		Germany). I'm sorry I missed the 2016 trip.
	* PHP|Tek was always great for meeting up with people from all over the world.
		And afterwards knowing exactly who that person from IRC, Twitter, that
		book you read, etc actually is.
	* I used to listen to EVE-Radio because I'd come across music from all over
		that I hadn't heard before. I've not found a good substitute, but I do run
		into some good music from a couple of friend's Twitch.tv streams.
	* I'm slowly progressing through a free version for my Kindle of The Art of
		War.

8. Please critique any of the SparkFun websites. With influence over the SparkFun dev team what would *you* focus on improving?

	* It might be useful to add a title attribute to elements wrapping certain
		acronyms that might be unfamiliar to first time visitors... Such as AVC,
		IoT, IMU. More common acronyms that the average person would immediately
		know (such as GPS and LCD) need not receive title attributes.
	* Tutorials link under the SHOP header is a bit disorienting unless you
		realize it's taking you out of the store and dropping you into Learn
		category of headers. Going into the forums and data completely loses the
		navigation, but is understandable. The forums' home icon at least leads
		back to the store, but the only link back I see on the data site is the
		link at the very bottom in the footer.
	* The website uses a superscript 3 (Â³) for some blog entries: "T^3: PixMob
		Mutaforma Teardown". This doesn't show up in all browsers - it's just a
		square in Opera 12.16 linux x86-64. It might be better if this was wrapped
		with the HTML sup (superscript) element.
	* Something I noticed in the AVC section... For the past years 2013 and older
		have the winners listed. It's a shame they don't seem to be listed for
		2014 and 2015.
