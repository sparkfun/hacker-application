Please answer the following general questions:

**1. When can you start?**
I can start on Monday May 1st, 2017.

**2. Do you have any planned vacations/absences in the next six months that we should know about?**
There is a plan to take a week away in the summer time, but the dates are not set yet.

**3. SparkFun is a dog-friendly environment. Are comfortable working aroung dogs? If you are a dog-owner, would you see yourself bringing dogs to work?**
I love dogs! I am a volunteer at the Animal House shelter in Fort Collins, where I help doggies get a second chance. At the moment I am not a dog owner, but I do foster dogs once in a while. I could see myself bringing a dog to work if allowed.

**4. The active developer keeps up on happenings in the world of development and technology. Where do you get your news?**
I get my technology news from different places online (websites and twitter) from TechCrunch, Wired, Reuters, IFL science, IEEE Spectrum and Ars Technica, to name a few. As well as podcasts and email newsletter subscriptions from Data Science Association News, LinkedIn, Medium, BuiltinColorado, among others. 

**5. The sane developer does things other than writing code. What else occupies your time?**
I love to dance, I did ballet professionally when I was younger, so dancing is a big part of my life. I take dance classes, as well I like to go sweat it out at salsa nights. Also, fitness is part of my everyday life, I take bootcamp classes or yoga every day and do hikes or skiing during the weekends.

**6. The worldy developer is in touch with some form of culture (books, music, film, etc.). How do you go about feeding this part of your brain?**
I keep up with the world dance, I keep track of the dance companies that come to Colorado, as well as the Colorado Ballet performances. Very frequently (almost monthly), we go to the Denver Performing Arts Complex to watch a dance performance, musical or opera.
I also have had the opportunity to travel and live in different parts of the world, so learning about new cultures and their traditions is something fascinating to me. If the opportunity arises, I like to travel and develop lasting relationships with people from around the world.

**7. Please critique any of the SparkFun websites. With influence over the SparkFun dev team what would *you* focus on improving?**
All SparkFun websites are already great. If I had the opportunity I would like to focus on improving the ecommerce and data SparkFun websites.

First, I would like to perform a design update for the ecommerce website. The more updated ecommerce websites are full width, menus are at the top (no longer on the left side), also these websites have full width images or video banners with simple menus. The key factor in any ecommerce is product findability, it would be useful to revise parent categories and accessibility to products, design and structure of menu and submenus (hover vs. click for submenu). This can be done with a data study of what products are most bought, searched for, just in general studying usage patterns and SparkFun goals to try to match these. 

Second, I would like to develop data.sparkfun to increase its usability by clarifying its usage and advantages by providing a more graphical explanation. Follow a route with less text, instead use animated or video explanation of the service, e.g. https://fi.google.com/about/ , https://www.dropbox.com
