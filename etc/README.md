Please answer the following administrative/personal questions:

1. What is your desired compensation range? (Range meaning the least you're comfortable with to the most you think you're worth.)
$50k to 65k

2. When can you start?
At the end of this month. I will have to relocate so some planning will need to go into that as well.

3. Do you have any planned vacations/absences in the next six months that we should know about?
No

4. Do you have any problem with dogs?
Absolutely not! I love dogs!

5. Please describe one of the greatest costumes you've ever attempted, Halloween or otherwise.
I'm not huge on dressing up. That said, my mom was always very into costumes so when I was younger I dressed up for every Halloween. The best one was probably the rabbit from Alice and Wonderland.

6. The active developer keeps up on happenings in the world of development. Where do you you get your news?
I idle a couple irc channels: #google, #git ... #sparkfun, #reprap ;). Some websites I frequent: Reddit, Gizmodo, Lifehacker, XKCD.

7. The sane developer does things besides write code. What occupies your time?
I have a ton of hobbies. I am a maker, I have a 3D Printer and I love tinkering with electronics. I have a few micro RC helicopters. This past winter was my second snowboarding season!

8. The worldy developer is in touch with some form of culture (books, movies, music, what have you). How do you go about feeding this part of your brain?
I like to blow out entire seasons of tv shows in a weekend (GO NETFLIX!). I stay generally up to date with movies. I go out to see about 8-9 a year. I haven't read much in the past few years but I am trying to get back into it. Currently reading Homeland.
