3. Do you have any planned vacations/absences in the next six months that we should know about?

4. SparkFun is a dog-friendly environment. Are comfortable working aroung dogs? If you are a dog-owner, would you see yourself bringing dogs to work?
Although I would not bring my dog to work, I am comfortable with dogs and other animals in the workplace.

5. The active developer keeps up on happenings in the world of development and technology. Where do you you get your news?
I use several news related sites to keep up with current (tech) events. 
http://www.theverge.com/
http://www.nbcnews.com/tech
http://www.wired.com/
I also subscribe to various news/podcast sites like IPVM. IPVM is very focused site and relevant to my current job. 
I discuss, suggest, and evaluate technology trends in 21st-century learning with teachers at a technology high school in Colorado Springs to help develop future technology innovators coming up in the workforce.

6. The sane developer does things other than writing code. What else occupies your time?
I love the outdoors - hiking, whitewater rafting, ATVing. I also volunteer with teachers in Colorado Springs to mentor their students when they work on engineering-related projects.

7. The worldy developer is in touch with some form of culture (books, music, film, etc.). How do you go about feeding this part of your brain?
I often go to the movies and watch historical documentaries. I read a lot of books, mostly by Steven King. I visit zoos and museums, especially natural history museums. I am also fascinated with learning about other cultures - their languages, their mythologies, their histories, their cultural mores. Before traveling to a new place, I research interesting, off-the-beaten-path sites to visit. I try to immerse myself in a culture when I visit rather than stay in the “touristy” areas.

8. Please critique any of the SparkFun websites. With influence over the SparkFun dev team what would *you* focus on improving?
Given the business motif and the products SparkFun offers, the overall website should showcase the unique experience that comes from using SparkFun products, which the “Shop” portion of the website does. I would not arbitrarily suggest any changes to the website without evaluating customer feedback and forums. Even then, any changes to the company website should involve a team effort, not the ideas of one individual. 
As a customer of SparkFun, I have always found that the navigation of the website allowed me to easily find the products I needed and is similar to other product sites. That similarity of navigation is actually useful as customers know what to expect and how to search. That said, one alteration we might consider evaluating is the background of the website. The white background with black or grey text creates a feeling of a base-model website that doesn’t stand out from the crowd.
