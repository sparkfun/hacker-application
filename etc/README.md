Please answer the following administrative/personal questions:

1. What is your desired compensation range? (Range meaning the least you're comfortable with to the most you think you're worth.)

I wouldn't be interested for any less than $58k and I wouldn't feel confident asking more than $63k.

2. When can you start?

Upon accepting a job offer, I would need to give my current employer a full 2 weeks notice to make sure they were covered before I left.

3. Do you have any planned vacations/absences in the next six months that we should know about?

I do not.

4. Do you have any problem with dogs?

No problems.

5. Please describe one of the greatest costumes you've ever attempted, Halloween or otherwise.

I was "Katy Perry" a few years ago. I'm a 6 foot tall large built guy. I had slightly less sex appeal than the real deal. I wore it to a local conservative church group Halloween party. That didn't go over so well. I wasn't invited to their Halloween get-togethers anymore. YOLO right?

6. The active developer keeps up on happenings in the world of development. Where do you you get your news?

I hang out in a few development IRC channels. We tend to bounce various development news and concepts around.

7. The sane developer does things besides write code. What occupies your time?

I have two boys (5 and 3 years old) and they are amazing. I record music and play guitar in a band with some friends. I like to buy and trade music gear. I pretend I'm an architect sometimes making attempts at designing house plans.

8. The worldy developer is in touch with some form of culture (books, movies, music, what have you). How do you go about feeding this part of your brain?

Streaming Netflix has become my "go to" place for television/film entertainment... which is unfortunate because I'm pretty sure they only get the leftover material when nobody else wants it. I like to pretend I'm a foodie, but when I'm equally impressed with the 6 Dollar Cheesburger at Carl's JR as I am with some $80 sushi dinner, I guess that makes me less of a foodie and more of a habitual over-eater.
