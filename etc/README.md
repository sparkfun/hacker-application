Please answer the following general questions:

1. What is your desired compensation range? (Range meaning the least you're comfortable with to the most you think you're worth.)

    $75,000 - $110,000 with my current skill set and considering the cost of living in the area.

2. When can you start?

    I have no limitations on when I can start but I would like to give at least two weeks notice at my current job. This way I can end my relationship with the University of Kansas amicably with no projects at loose ends and locate housing in the area.

3. Do you have any planned vacations/absences in the next six months that we should know about?

    I have no planned events in the next six months (January - June) except for enough time to set up housing and fully transition my family to the area.

4. SparkFun is a dog-friendly environment. Are comfortable working around dogs? If you are a dog-owner, would you see yourself bringing dogs to work?

    I love pets of all sorts. I currently have a pair of cats but while growing up, I had several dogs. If in the future I get a dog, it will depend on the animal's temperament if I would bring it in to an office environment.

5. The active developer keeps up on happenings in the world of development and technology. Where do you get your news?

    I'm subscribed to several mailing lists and G+ groups on software and tech. I also have a couple subreddits I'm subscribed to on related fields. Otherwise I read the news. Google's curated news feed does a decent job of showing me tech advances.

6. The sane developer does things other than writing code. What else occupies your time?

    As I noted in my cover letter, I'm a maker. Okay so that may still involve writing code at times. But it also involves 3D modeling, wood working, metal working, leather working, sewing, and more. I also like to play computer games (PS4 and PC). On the more physical side of things, I try to stay fit and go to the gym though I much prefer to go swimming or biking when the weather is right. Lastly, I love snow and water skiing. Whenever I have a chance, I love to strap on skis and go.

7. The worldy developer is in touch with some form of culture (books, music, film, etc.). How do you go about feeding this part of your brain?

    It is more of a challenge to stop me from absorbing media. I love watching a new movie in theaters (big fan of the MCU and Star Wars films). I have dozens of books in my kindle library and even more in my physical one. Currently, I prefer e-books because I can bring them everywhere I have my phone. As to music, I don’t think I could live without music. I’ll frequently listen to music while working on code and always have the radio on while driving.

8. Please critique any of the SparkFun websites. With influence over the SparkFun dev team what would *you* focus on improving?

	One improvement I think could be made is unifying the site layout a bit more. When navigating to Data, the standard UI is out the window. Similarly, for navigating to the Forums the site UI changes, though I recognize that PHPBB forums can be a bit of a pain to style.

	The calendar on the Learning subdomain looks very sparse. With the amount of empty days on the currently calendar, I think it would be easier to see upcoming events first off as a long-term agenda view with the optional tab to a calendar view.

	Once Bootstrap 4 comes out, I'd consider updated the bootstrap basis to it.

	One bug I noticed while browsing the SparkFun product listing is that the individual product wishlist drop downs are not displaying properly. Their container is hiding overflow beyond the product block.

	Otherwise, I would want to see metrics and user interaction heat-maps to make decisions on UI layout adjustments. It would be the most efficient way to determine if some element of the UI is causing users trouble or requires a larger focus in the layout.
