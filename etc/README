Please answer the following administrative/personal questions:

1. What is your desired compensation range?
   (Range meaning the least you're comfortable with
    to the most you think you're worth. As stated in
    the position description, salary is negotiable)

   $55,000 to $75,000
2. When can you start?

   I would need to give the cursory 2 weeks notice at my current place
   of employment, which means about 2 weeks after you decide that I am 
   a good fit. ^_^

3. Do you have any planned vacations/absences in the next
   six months that we should know about?

   No.  However it may be worth mentioning that I do enjoy taking a trip
   once a year to climb internationally.

4. Any problem with dogs?

   My only problem with dogs is that I do not have one.  I stay busy enough
   that a dog would most likely spend the majority of its time at home alone.
   As a remedy, I have dogs, vicariously, through friends.
