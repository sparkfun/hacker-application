Please answer the following administrative/personal questions:

What is your desired compensation range? (Range meaning the least you're comfortable with to the most you think you're worth.)

`25k-35k.  I'm looking to gain experience as a developer.  I've got a wide range of skills and a lot of ingenuity but I haven't had the opportunity to work in an environment yet that really pushed my ability. I'm looking to build that skill set and I hope given the opportunity to show my versatility and skill.  I've taken a year off of development to find my bearings and figure out what I really love.  I've got several years of experience in the realm of Windows development (ASP.NET, C#, SQL) but very little open source development experience.  I want to find a job to help me bridge the gap in my experience.  But more than that I want to work with fun people, work on projects that are meaningful where I can be creative and be able to delve into a few different forms of programming.  I'm really interested in Arduino as well as C++ programming to run Beagle board and stuff like that.  The Windows development path is no longer attractive to me.  I enjoy developing web applications in ASP.NET MVC 4 but all of my desire to build software for the Windows Store or to build Windows 8 applications has gone out the window (lol).  Everything I want to develop for revolves around Ruby & PHP, Android API or iPhone.`

When can you start?

`I can start immediately.`

Do you have any planned vacations/absences in the next six months that we should know about?

`I would like to possibly take a Monday following a weekend off within the next 1-2 months.  Beyond that, it depends on my girlfriend's schedule.  She rarely gets multiple weeks off at a time, so it's not something I anticipate for the next 6 months.`

Do you have any problem with dogs?

`I don't.  I love dogs.  I have a Jack Russell terrier, my family, friends, girlfriend all have dog/s.`

Please describe one of the greatest costumes you've ever attempted, Halloween or otherwise.

`This last Halloween I dressed as a terrorist (photo attached).  I built a home-made "bomb" with modeling clay, old cell-phone, stencil set and parachute cord.  The "bomb" was "lost" at First Bank Center.  I had tossed around the idea of dressing as Joe Paterno.  My friend actually provided me with some excellent inspirational photos of another friend (photo attached) who pulled this off very successfully.  This year I'm mulling over pairs costumes (grilled cheese sandwich + tomato soup or Zelda + Princess), famous scientist (Carl Sagan or Richard Feynman) or possibly Gamera (the fire-breathing turtle).`

The active developer keeps up on happenings in the world of development. Where do you you get your news?

`I've been reading Dr. Dobbs for 10 years.  Mostly just to really delve down into more complex programming.  Honestly, most of the programming I've done is really mundane.  It's been IDX systems for Realtors, small shopping carts, basic websites.  It is really fun to see what people are coding even if I have no immediate use for it myself.  I subscribe to Code magazine.  It is the purest and I feel the best of the .NET development magazines.  Here is my go to list for information feeds: Google+, SitePoint/Learnable, O'Reilly (network and radar), StackOverflow, Rubyists on Twitter (Michael Hartl, James Edward Gray II, Matt Long, Envy Labs), Ruby Rogues, Kippt feed (web dev, javascript, python/django, awesome, etc.), Net Tut+ and whole bunch of design/css inspiration type blogs.`

The sane developer does things besides write code. What occupies your time?

`I like to walk, run, bike and spend time outside on the trails around Boulder.  I love to cook and spend time with my girlfriend.  I'm interested in food and farm-to-table, CSA's, wineries, breweries, etc.  I race R/C cars at the two tracks in the Denver area (MHOR and Unser Racing).  I love to read.  I read a ton of science fiction and science fact.  I'm getting into electronics.  My friend and I are developing a product with Raspberry Pi innards and we're working on customizing a version of Raspbian “wheezy” to add some basic features.  I'm trying to learn French, mostly because I think it's sexy and the universal food language.  I spend a good amount of time reading Astronomy blogs and stargazing.`

The worldy developer is in touch with some form of culture (books, movies, music, what have you). How do you go about feeding this part of your brain?

`I'll try not to bore with too much geek detail.  Reading is pretty core to me.  On average, I read a good 10 books a month about half fiction/half non-fiction.  I like science, math and philosophy, in particular.  This month I'm reading Six Easy Pieces/Six Not So Easy Pieces by Richard Feynman, 1001 Things Everyone Should Know About Science by James Trefil and The Nature of Things by Lucretious.  I read a lot of science fiction.  Last week I read Joe Scalzi's Old Man's War trilogy.  I'm not against reading literature if I can get into it.  When it comes to movies I spend most of my time with comedies, action or sci-fi.  I actually thought That's My Boy was really hilarious.  I keep extensive lists on IMDB (of, course).  Music wise I have very diverse tastes and a Spotify Premium account.  I listen to everything but country, jazz or rap, with a few exceptions.  Crystal Castles, M83, Deadmau 5 are my favorite artists right now.  I'm anxious for TechJect to release their robot dragonfly.  I'm getting into Sphero development.  I like how they've designed their gyro.  A friend of a friend did some of the initial programming for Sphero and has given me some details.  Really cool stuff.  When you hire a chaos mathematican to get a ball to roll straighter that kinda gets me excited!  I spend most of my time thinking about big thoughts in the realm of physics, robotics, mathematics, biology and chemistry.  I obsess about thoughts.  I can't really turn off my brain so I have to put it to work to stay sane.`
