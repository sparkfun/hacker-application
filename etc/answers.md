Please answer the following general questions:

**1. What is your desired compensation range? (Range meaning the least you're comfortable with to the most you think you're worth.)**
98k-105k
With my experience as a senior level full stack web developer I would be able to hit the ground running on any project and provide my years of experience to SparkFun. (I know this is out of your pay range, but SparkFun is such an awesome company I have to try)

**2. When can you start?**
I can start with 2 weeks notice.

**3. Do you have any planned vacations/absences in the next six months that we should know about?**
I am planing on taking a long weekend Sept 25-28th.

**4. SparkFun is a dog-friendly environment. Are comfortable working around dogs? If you are a dog-owner, would you see yourself bringing dogs to work?**
I love dogs! My current employer has a dog friendly environment. I have 2 miniature Australian Shepherds, but unfortunately only one of them like to ride in the car but I do love to bring her in from time to time.

**5. The active developer keeps up on happenings in the world of development and technology. Where do you you get your news?**
The main website I use is engadget. I also like to keep up on bitcoin news as well so I get a newsletter from cryptocoinsnews.com

**6. The sane developer does things other than writing code. What else occupies your time?**
When I am not working I love to do things that relax me. This includes playing with my 2 young boys, watching a new play, camping, finding a new restaurant or just staying in and watching Netflix.

**7. The worldly developer is in touch with some form of culture (books, music, film, etc.). How do you go about feeding this part of your brain?**
I love movies, books and TV shows. I am a huge sci-fi (go figure). So I love things like Dr Who, Star Trek, Star Wars, the Iron Druid series, the Harry Dresden series, comic book movies etc..

**8. Please critique any of the SparkFun websites. With influence over the SparkFun dev team what would *you* focus on improving?**
Overall I really like the SparkFun website. Something I wish I could do in the website is be able to do a guided type of search by attributes. As in being able to select "Arduino", "Wifi", "USB" to find any boards that have these attributes. This would allow me to search for products that I don't know the name of but I have use for.
