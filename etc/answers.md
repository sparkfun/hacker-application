Please answer the following general questions:

**1. What is your desired compensation range? (Range meaning the least you're comfortable with to the most you think you're worth.)**
105k-110k
With my experience as a senior level full stack web developer I would be able to hit the ground running on any project and provide my years of experience to SparkFun.

**2. When can you start?**
I can start with 2 weeks notice.

**3. Do you have any planned vacations/absences in the next six months that we should know about?**
I plan on taking a week vacation in August.

**4. SparkFun is a dog-friendly environment. Are comfortable working around dogs? If you are a dog-owner, would you see yourself bringing dogs to work?**
I love dogs! My previous employer allowed dogs and it was great to have your furry friends around. I am currently looking for the right dog for my girlfriend and I. We want to get an adult basset hound.

**5. The active developer keeps up on happenings in the world of development and technology. Where do you you get your news?**
I have been using an Android app called Appy Geek. It aggregates news from a ton of tech sites. Keeps me up to date on the current news.

**6. The sane developer does things other than writing code. What else occupies your time?**
When I am not working I love to do things that are relaxing. This includes playing with my 2 young boys, watching a new play, camping, finding a new restaurant or just staying in and watching Netflix with my girlfriend.

**7. The worldly developer is in touch with some form of culture (books, music, film, etc.). How do you go about feeding this part of your brain?**
I love movies, books and TV shows. I am a huge sci-fi (go figure). So I love things like Dr Who, Star Trek, Star Wars, the Iron Druid series, the Harry Dresden series, comic book movies etc..

**8. Please critique any of the SparkFun websites. With influence over the SparkFun dev team what would *you* focus on improving?**
Overall I really like the SparkFun website. Something I wish I could do in the website is be able to do a "guided search" by attributes. As in being able to select "Arduino", "Wifi", "USB" to find any boards that have these 3 attributes. This would allow me to search for products that I don't know the name of but I have use for.
