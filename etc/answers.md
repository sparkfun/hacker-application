4. SparkFun is a dog-friendly environment. Are comfortable working aroung dogs? If you are a dog-owner, would you see yourself bringing dogs to work?

> I grew up with dogs as pets, and i’m really comfortable around them.  Unfortunately I do not currently own a dog.

5. The active developer keeps up on happenings in the world of development and technology. Where do you you get your news?

> I subscribe to a couple mailing lists that are centered around front end development and Javascript: CSS Tricks, and Pony Foo.

6. The sane developer does things other than writing code. What else occupies your time?

> I enjoy spending time running to refresh my mind after a day of writing code. In the spring and summer, I follow baseball and root for my home team, the Detroit Tigers. I have an obsession with weather. It fascinates me, and I follow local and national weather closely through subscribing to different blogs and following the National Weather Service.  I also enjoy spending time with my wife and friends. 

7. The worldy developer is in touch with some form of culture (books, music, film, etc.). How do you go about feeding this part of your brain?

> My default is to watch sport and follow sports, it’s what I have been into my whole life and what I most enjoy. I have also always loved reading non-fiction books, but am getting into reading fiction. My current read is Ready Player One by Ernest Cline.  

8. Please critique any of the SparkFun websites. With influence over the SparkFun dev team what would *you* focus on improving?

> I would want to focus in on development process.  I am someone who enjoys reflecting on the efficiency of processes. Efficient processes not only improve productivity, but lead to higher quality work, and a more enjoyable process. Unfortunately, I have seen the project development life cycle approached in a brute force way to just get it done in the time allotted.  Now this was effective at reaching a deadline but also introduced more technical debt that could have been avoided through planning.  This being said, I don’t know the typical workflow of the Sparkfun Development team, but if given the opportunity to be part of it I would strive to be an advocate for an efficient project development and feature implementation. 
> Initially, I spent some time going through the SparkFun website, and it seems to be well put together, with quick load times on both desktop and mobile. Even with network throttling turned on 4G (Chrome Dev Tools), content still loaded in under 4 seconds, which is good but some may argue there is room for improvement. The main thing I would like see to improved on the site, which could be a personal preference, is to simplify the UX for mobile. Currently its responsive nature is to include everything from the desktop version and have containers set to 100% screen width. Assuming that web traffic at SparkFun is similar to other projects I have worked on, about 50% of users (give or take) access content from a mobile device. Most users won’t take the time to scroll down a long page on mobile, which means that the browser is taking a few extra precious seconds to load content that won’t be consumed by the user.  My suggestion would be to trim down the amount of content, and implement lazy loading for things such as product lists or blog posts.  Also, through analyzing analytics for the site, I would like to take a look at what people tend to visit while on mobile and make it easier to navigate to those areas of the site.
