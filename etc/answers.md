Please answer the following general questions:

1. What is your desired compensation range? (Range meaning the least you're comfortable with to the most you think you're worth.)

* The least I need to support my family is about 80K, the amount I think I'm worth? Uh... priceless (~110K would convince me to stay).

2. When can you start?

* Pretty much anytime.

3. Do you have any planned vacations/absences in the next six months that we should know about?

* Maybe a week in October... but nothing set.

4. SparkFun is a dog-friendly environment. Are comfortable working aroung dogs? If you are a dog-owner, would you see yourself bringing dogs to work?

* Yes! I do own a dog, but she loves people so much that her love would take over SparkFun.

5. The active developer keeps up on happenings in the world of development and technology. Where do you you get your news?

* I'll follow blogs of developers from companies that are doing cool things. Like: [Wix engineering blog](http://blog.wix.engineering/). I do a lot of github repo sniffing and general searching of comparisons of technologies.

6. The sane developer does things other than writing code. What else occupies your time?

* Mostly time outside. Usually on a trail. Avid cyclist and nordic skier. Will occasionally do something big, like ride the Colorado Trail to/from Durango.

7. The worldy developer is in touch with some form of culture (books, music, film, etc.). How do you go about feeding this part of your brain?

* Big KGNU fan and will usually ask my wife what book I should read next or find a futuristic book about the end of the world.

8. Please critique any of the SparkFun websites. With influence over the SparkFun dev team what would *you* focus on improving?

* Specific:
Looks like you guys have done a great job and covered your bases. It might be worth looking at this: [https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sparkfun.com](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sparkfun.com) 
and try to move https://cdn.optimizely.com/js/2005040085.js with the rest of the JavaScript at the bottom of the page.

* Functionality:
I could see maybe giving the site some more "JavaScript'ish usability" functionality. For example, the nav has an expander for submenu items - I could see having the same functionality that
currently exists, but if you click on the + icon it expands the menu instead of loading the category page with the menu expanded. A quick view could be good for the products... a modal so the user
doesn't lose their shopping flow.

* Vision:
The opportunities to build tools and interactive web applications are huge when considering the benefit of educating users and offering
resources like your sparkfuneducation.com site. Creating a virtual application that could mimic the actual construction of SparkFun components
in a similar way as building a prototype for a website would be fun to build and to use.
