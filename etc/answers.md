1. What is your desired compensation range?

Though I am one of the Degreeless, I believe this does not hinder me, so commensurate with experience. Maybe..$45 to $50 and go from there!?!?! Always an awkward question.

2. When can you start?

Now, please.

3. Do you have any planned vacations/absences in the next six months that we should know about?

Nope.

4. Do you have any problem with dogs?

Uhh. That's a loaded question. In my house? Well I just redid my carpet so I would prefer not there.

5. Please describe one of the greatest costumes you've ever attempted, Halloween or otherwise.

That's an easy one, wasn't even an attempt. I am on the [left](http://i.imgur.com/6E3wvtf.jpg). 

I swear to god that entire costume was conceived, planned and constructed by my 10 year old self.

6. The active developer keeps up on happenings in the world of development. Where do you you get your news?

Cop out answer but Coding Horror is always worth a read. Honestly I probably don't actively keep up as much as I should I feel like I get a lot of my info through osmosis via StackOverflow answers. Find answer -> read about technology -> research technology -> buy books -> ??? -> profit?

7. The sane developer does things besides write code. What occupies your time?

Snowboarding, woodworking, shorthand, oh got I just had to check my facebook likes to remember what I do, rock climbing at the SPOT, flying my RC helicopter, working on my truck in a non-rednecky way, programming (yes I do that in my free time too), reading (fantasy, sci-fi or non-fiction), trying to fix my entire yard by myself (digging, plumbing, sprinkler systems, deckbuilding, gardening)

8. The worldy developer is in touch with some form of culture (books, movies, music, what have you). How do you go about feeding this part of your brain?

Never stop reading. Right now I am reading:

+ DNS and BIND (I wish DNS still didn't seem like devil magic)
+ Tao Te Ching
+ Re-reading Wheel of Time so I can finally read the new books

Also really enjoy listening to music, but I won't try to turn this into FaceBook profile rev 2.
