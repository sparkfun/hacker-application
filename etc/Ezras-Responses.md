Please answer the following general questions:

### When can you start?
If possible, I might request 2 to 3 weeks to tie up loose ends with my current job at CU and leave them in a good place. I 
have offered to help the School of Education find my replacement. 

### Do you have any planned vacations/absences in the next six months that we should know about?
I'll be spending 7-8 days in the Pennsylvania/Ohio area in July. I have designs to see Niagara Falls during this trip!

### SparkFun is a dog-friendly environment. Are comfortable working around dogs? If you are a dog-owner, would you see yourself bringing dogs to work?
Growing up, my mother was a zoo keeper, and now she runs a successful dog daycare. I love dogs dearly, the more the merrier. I don't have any dogs 
of my own currently, but should that change, they'd likely make it to work with me regularly.

### The active developer keeps up on happenings in the world of development and technology. Where do you you get your news?
Wired and Slashdot are my two go-to's. NPR's "all tech considered" is also great.

### The sane developer does things other than writing code. What else occupies your time?
I'm an avid basketball fan, both playing in the park and cheering on the Nuggets. I volunteer for the non-profit Boulder Food Rescue, biking foods 
being thrown away at local grociery stores to food banks, housing co-ops, and churches in town. I'm also a competitive pinball player.

### The worldy developer is in touch with some form of culture (books, music, film, etc.). How do you go about feeding this part of your brain?
I've lived a block from Boulder Theater for 6 years, and have seen countless concerts there. Also, I've been in an informal book 
club with a group my friends for the last few years. Recently, we've read Ready Player One, Mr. Penumbra's 24 Hour Bookstore, and War 
with the Newts, all three of which I would strongly recommend.

### Please critique any of the SparkFun websites. With influence over the SparkFun dev team what would you focus on improving?
In my opinion, SparkFun's suite of websites are very professionally done. Perhaps some work could go into helping 
the code validate according to W3. I have encountered a number of Sparkfun pages that have underscores, which I've understood to be less desirable than hyphens for SEO purposes. 
Google does seem to change these all the time, thought. SparkFun's homepage itself is a bit bulky, and perhaps could be optimized a touch. (It does appear there are a few inline styles here and there.) 
The load speed is most noticeable on mobile devices. On another note, I'm really interested in data.sparkfun.com and see much potential for this to grow. I'd like to organize 
each of the data streams into categories to give some structure when browsing.
