5. I grew a beard for zombie Abe Lincoln one year for halloween :)

6. Python usergroups, google+, forums, irc (mostly freenode, #python,
#django, #php, etc)

7. Cars have been my main hobby for a long time, particularly drifting.  I also have a moped from
the '70s that I restored and use for transportation occasionally, when I'm not tinkering with it.
The saying goes "the ped's always broke, but its easy to fix!" I can also play a mean game of
starcraft 2

9. Lived in Finland for over a year; multilingual.  I love non-fiction, documentaries, and the
occasional Colbert Report.  I play the guitar and the cello.  Browsing wikipedia aimlessly for hours is my
guilty pleasure
